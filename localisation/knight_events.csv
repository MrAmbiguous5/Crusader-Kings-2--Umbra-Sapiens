EVTDESC_equus.1022;Your old squire [From.GetFirstName] returns to you one day bringing a gift: it is an ancient sword they found in their travels, they gift it to you in memory of old times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1022;Tell me all about your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB_equus.1033;They're wasted on a mere squire! They will be mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1033;Wait until marriage for such things;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.1033;I will teach you how to sway hearts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1034;You hear from reputable sources that your squire has been turning to sins of gambling and the flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1034;This is no way to act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1034;Those sound like good sins;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1034;They must face their own temptations;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.1034;I will give them a good long lecture;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1035;Your squire runs up to you looking quite worried. Apparently they have offended a local lord and fears the consequences for themself.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTOOLTIPA_equus.1036;[From.GetFirstName] will reconsider their decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1036;I will make you regret it if you leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTD_equus.1036;Please remember all the good times we had!;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_equus.1039;You hear from reputable sources that your squire has been frequenting people of a disreputable nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1039;Promise me that you won't see them again;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1039;I would love to meet these friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1039;Let them have their fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.1039;Do not go against the will of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1040;You've noticed your squire holding some rather unorthodox views about God and the Church. Some may even say they are heretical...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1040;Come back to the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1040;Dear God, you're right!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1040;I will not question their faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.1040;Let us read the Bible together;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_equus.1043;Training countless hours with your squire has made you appreciate them more than you expected. Maybe this could turn into a friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1043;What do you say, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1043;I might show you my bedchamber;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1043;I mean, he's ok;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1044;Your relationship with your squire has become more and more strained in recent times and now he finally snapped. He no longer wants to be your servant and hopes that the world will soon be rid of you.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1044;How could you [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1044;Only one of us will leave unscathed!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1045;You receive troubling reports that your squire has abused their authority and has looted several small villages. The peasants are clamoring for you to react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1045;I will pay back the damages done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1045;[From.GetFirstName] will be delivered unarmed to the villagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPB_equus.1045;[From.GetFirstName] might not make it out alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTC_equus.1060;Only the most handsome of horses will do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.1060;Only the most bellicose horse will do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1061;After long years of loyal service, your faithful steed has galloped his last.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1061;I'll find another to serve me just as well;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1061;Oh cruel fate!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1061;Everything I care about dies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1065;During your adventures, you notice in the distance thirty or fourty giants waving their long arms. Surely you will be blessed for removing such foul creatures from the earth!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1065;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1066;During your adventures, you come across a small village with a certain commotion going on. The beautiful woman amongst them must be a princess captured by bandits! You fight your way through but the peasants beat you and say you ruined their wedding;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_equus.1241;Your brother [From.GetTitledName] has been tragically injured in your tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1213;All this hitting each other with sharp objects has made you realize that you'd much rather have someone else fight for you.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1213;Get that thing away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1214;The displays of valor in front of you have spurred you to aim for greater feats of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1214;For glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1215;The Great Toournament has allowed you to increase your martial skills far beyond your youthful education.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1215;They didn't teach this back at home!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1218;The Great Toournament has shown that your martial skills are really very rusty and you aren't able to fight like you used to.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1218;Oh the shame!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1221;As you're walking through the tournament ground you notice some scantly clad ladies offering a different kind of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1221;I like the sound of that;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1221;Oh the times we live in!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1221;Actually, that stable boy isn't half bad;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1222;Among the stalls in the tournament ground you notice a magician conjuring a dove from thin air. He appears to be very popular with the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1222;Silly tricks for peasants;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1222;We shouldn't be promoting witchcraft!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1222;I'll show a trick or two of my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1223;Among the stalls in the tournament ground you notice a wrinkled old woman dispensing herbal remedies in exchange for a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1223;The people are always credulous;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1223;Guards, arrest this witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1223;There's no harm in trying them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1224;Seeing all these muscular men exercising their bodies and tuning them to perfection has made you reconsider your tastes.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1224;Oh my!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1225;After enjoying some of the more sensual attractions of the torunament, you begin to notice that all is not well south of the waist.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1225;Well this is embarassing...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1226;In your days at the tournament you've been sampling more and more drinks to the point that now you stumble around the field looking for the next pint.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1226;Jush one mehr drink;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1227;Being surrounded by so many talented soldiers has allowed you to learn several useful tricks. You can now confidentely boast of your dueling ability;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1227;Now I am the master;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1228;Being a woman in such a military contest has attracted many poorly concealed comments and jokes towards you. It's starting to get on your nerves...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1228;I will stab anyone else who comments;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1228;I'll show them in the competition;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1229;Returning to your tent, you notice a merchant being robbed. One of the robbers sees you and offers to split the money with you if you keep quiet;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1229;Get back you barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1229;Nothing to see here...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1230;Among the stalls of the tournament grounds, you notice several people gambling and the table closest to you has just lost a player.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1230;I'm feeling lucky;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1230;I have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1230;I'll use my "special" dice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1231;Lady luck is with you today, you manage to accumulate some sizable winnings.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1231;Thank you gentlemen;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1232;Lady luck is not with you today, you manage to accumulate a significant debt.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1232;I'm out;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1233;One of the merchants in the tournament grounds is selling some holy relics. They are quite expensive but they look quite good;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1233;This is a bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1233;I don't trust him;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1233;Wait, that's just a dog bone!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1234;You return to your tent and show your new relic to some friends. Problems arise when one of them says they also bought the head of John the Baptist from the same merchant and a two headed saint is a very rare thing.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1234;Dirty conman!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1235;You confront the salesman and he pales at the realization. He begs you to take a part of his profits if you won't say anything to the customers.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1235;Guards, arrest this man!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1235;I'll take your generous donation;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1260;You ready yourself for the joust and recognize your opponent. The crowd murmurs in anticipation as you both mount your steeds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1260;Prepare yourself [opponent_knight.GetTitle] [opponent_knight.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1261w;You manage to win the round but become injured in the process. You must decide if you feel able to face another fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1261l;You are defeated in this round and become injured as a consequence of your unhorsing. The tournament ends here for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1261lf;You are defeated in this round and become injured as a consequence of your unhorsing. Despite this, you still have a chance to arrive third. Are you able to face another fight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1261;It's just a flesh wound!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1261;I've had enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1262w;You manage to win the round but become badly injured in the process. You must decide if you feel able to face another fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_equus.1262lf;You are defeated in this round and become badly injured as a consequence of your unhorsing. Despite this, you still have a chance to arrive third. Are you able to face another fight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1263;As you ride towards your opponent you see their lance pointing too far up and panic overtakes you as you see it speed towards your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1263;Arghh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1264l;You are defeated in this round, the tournament ends here for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1264lf;You are defeated in this round but you still have a chance to arrive third.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1264;I can still do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1264;I'm going home;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1265;You manage to win the round and ride triumphantly around the courtiard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1265;Who's next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1266;After the joust you obtain a certain respect and admiration for [opponent_knight.GetTitle] [opponent_knight.GetFirstName], you wouldn't mind seeing a lot more of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1266;Good fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1267;After the joust you find yourself outraged and disgusted with [opponent_knight.GetTitle] [opponent_knight.GetFirstName], you won't be associating with them any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1267;Away with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1270;You have been crowned the winner of the Grand Tournament, now it's time to bask in the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Artifact quest
EVTTITLE_equus.1500;The Great Quest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1500;Your Order is abuzz with the news that has just come in. A most holy artifact is rumored to be in the grandmaster's lands. Every knight worthy of that name is preparing for the adventure ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1500;In the name of God!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1500;I'm needed elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1502;Your squire claims to have seen where most of the other knights are headed. He urges you to follow them to get to the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1502;They must have a good reason;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1502;Being many doesn't make them right;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1503;Your squire claims to know someone with knowledge of the artifact. It appears they live onlya small detour away.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1503;Let's see what they know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1503;We don't have time to go after hunches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1504;Your squire claims to have read of the whereabouts of the artifact. It was a while ago but time is of the essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1504;I trust your memory;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1504;I should double check this information;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1505;In your travels, you find a peasant claiming to know where the artifact is to be found. He holds out a hand expectantly as he waits to take you onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1505;Alright, here is your pay;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1505;I will break that hand if you don't take me to the artifact!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1505;Come now, good fellow, it's all for the glory of God;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1506;You have noticed that some fellow knights have taken to reading dusty old tomes to find information about the whereabouts of the artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1506;Quick! To the oldest library you can find!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1506;Real research is done in the field!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1507;One of your fellow knights rides on with purpose clutching an old piece of parchment that appears to contain a map. Now they are asleep and the map is just out of their guard...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1507;I'll take that!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1507;I don't need to steal to find the artifact;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1508;As you wander in search of the artifact, a ferocious beast takes you by surprise. You have mere moments to collect yourself before it charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1508;Another trophy for my mantelpiece!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1508;My squire will protect me!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1508;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1509;As you wander in search of the artifact, you come across a small party of bandits blocking the way through. How will you proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1509;Come at me, bretheren!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1509;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1509;I'm sure I can sneak around;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1510;During your search, you encounter an old fisherman who offers you lodging. Once you reach his castle, he reveals himslf to be a weak and bedridden king and provides you with a grand feast. Before the feast begins, you witness a procession with a fair damsel carrying a wide plate, a handsome knight carrying a lance and one more champion carrying a glowing chalice.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1510;How strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1510;What is their purpose? Who do they serve?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1520;After long and gruelling travels, you come upon a small abandoned monastery that all the clues have pointed to. As you enter, you notice that it is covered in symbols and one very prominent riddle. You have one chance to prove yourself and find the artifact, how will that be?;;;;;;;;;;
find_grail;You succeed in finding the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;
lose_grail;You fail to find the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1520;I will solve the riddle;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.1520;I will tear this place apart;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.1520;I will study the symbols;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1521;You remove a well placed stone in the ruins and finally you see it! All this work has finally come to fruition!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1521;It's beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1522;You've looked everywhere but you can't see anything. Could all the evidence have been wrong? You look for any possible hiding place but there are none left to find. You leave this place wretched and wondering if maybe some higher power hid the artifact from you.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1522;Noooooooo!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1523;You have looked across the land for clues and guides but none of them have taken you in the right direction, it's finally time to give up the quest. Maybe someone else will have more luck in finding this mythical artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1523;Alas I am not the one;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.1524;There is a great celebration at the court of your grandmaster: [grail_finder.GetBestName] has found the artifact and now proudly displays it for all to see in the great hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.1524;Congratulations, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;

#Pas d'armes active
EVTDESC_equus.2260;After waiting for a while at your chosen spot, you see a knight approach you and you issue your challenge. They ready themselves and wait for the coming blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.2260;Prepare yourself [combatant_2.GetTitle] [combatant_2.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.2262;You survived another duel but you can feel that it has taxed you. You must decide if you feel able to face another fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.2262lf;You have finally faced enough opponents to end your challenge honorably. You can return home in the knowledge of a job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.2262;I will keep going!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.2262;I've had enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.2262;At last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Pas d'armes receptive
EVTDESC_equus.2270;As you are travelling with your entourage you find a fellow knight guarding a bridge. They challenge you to a duel for passage, your attendants look at you expectantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.2270;Prepare yourself [combatant_2.GetTitle] [combatant_2.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.2270;I'm sure we can find another crossing;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Great feast
EVTTITLE_equus.3200;The Great Feast;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3200;You have sent letters to invite all your brothers in the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3200;It will be quite a sight;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3201;Grandmaster [From.GetFirstName] has called you to participate in a Great Feast celebrating the virtues of your Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3201;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.3201;I have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3203;After innumerable days of feasting and celebrating the Order, the Great Feast has concluded and the knights return to their courts with the memory of such a remarkable event;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3203;It was a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3205;It is customary for each knight to perform a speech proving their eloquence. You have a few days before it is your turn, what will be the subject of your speech?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3205;I will praise God;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3205;I will praise my courtly love;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.3205;I will praise the head of my Order;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.3205;I will praise knightly virtues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3206;The final words of your speech hang in the air for a moment before being followed by a thunderous applause. As you return to your table, you are stopped by fellow knights who compliment your eloquence and choice of theme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3206;Thank you, thank you;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3207;The ending of your speech is followed by some polite clapping. Your words are quickly forgotten as the next knight begins their speech and you return to your meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3207;At least I'm done;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3208;You end the speech and are struck first by a silence and then some subdued murmuring. A cough from the audience alerts you to the fact that you should probably leave without much eye contact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3208;Tough crowd;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3213;After a few drinks, you enter a deep conversation with [discussion_knight.GetBestName] about the knightly virtue of justice. Is it really absolute or is it not possible to make such judgements?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3213;The virtue of justice is absolute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3213;Every case must be judged separately;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3214;At the feast, you and [discussion_knight.GetBestName] end up discussing the nature of bravery. If one should test their mettle in battle or wether it is wiser to employ stratagems to ensure one's safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3214;A true knight faces their foes head on!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3214;It is better to ponder than to be rash;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3215;While enjoying a particularly good boar, you start to talk with [discussion_knight.GetBestName] and you end up discussing the virtue of mercy. Should you spare your enemy or is it better to stop them fighting you again?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3215;It is only honorable to spare them;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3215;Some people are just to dangerous;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3216;As your host brings out another course of mouth-watering food, you make some remarks to [discussion_knight.GetBestName] that make you think about the nature of generosity. Should you hand out your wealth to friends or is it just a way to attract leeches?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3216;Honor demands that you share with your companions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3216;You should earn everything you gain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3217;After the jesters have left the room, you and [discussion_knight.GetBestName] begin discussing the idea of nobility. Should a person hold their ideals tight or is it acceptable to bend them for the greater good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3217;You should never equivocate on your opinions;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3217;It can be necessary to be more flexible;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3218;The days you have spent in the company of your fellow knights have really given you an insight on the diplomatic arts. As such, your skills have increased far beyond what your educators had taught you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3218;Such a fruitful feast!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3219;The days you have spent in the company of your fellow knights have made you realize how unskilled you really are in the diplomatic arts. As such, your skills have decreased even below what your educators had taught you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3219;I should have stayed home;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3220;One evening, you notice a [donna_angelo.GetManWoman] making [donna_angelo.GetHerHis] way towards you. As [donna_angelo.GetSheHe] get's closer to you, you realize that it is [donna_angelo.GetBestName]! With slurred words, [donna_angelo.GetSheHe] whispers a surprisingly long list of lewd suggestions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3220;I like what you're thinking;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.3220;I think you should cut down on the wine [donna_angelo.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3221;Wine and ale flow like rivers and you're joyfully gobbling them up at every chance you get. It seems you have developed a taste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3221;Wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3222;As course after course of rich food arrives at your table, you find yourself always asking for a second helping. Food really tastes so good;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3222;More!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3223;[discussion_knight.GetBestName] nods in agreement at your argument and invites you over for another drink together;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3223;Such a nice person!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.3224;[discussion_knight.GetBestName] is taken aback by your reply and it seems like [discussion_knight.GetSheHe] might have been offended by your remark;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.3224;I guess it was a touchy subject;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Courtly seduction
EVTTITLE_equus_4100;Courtly Love;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4100;Since you have set your eyes on [target_courted.GetBestName], you've known that there is something special about [target_courted.GetHerHim]. This is no mere physical attraction but it is the pure and chaste spirit of courtly love. You now begin planning how to win [target_courted.GetHerHis] heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4100;[target_courted.GetSheHeCap] will be mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4102;Since you have set your eyes on [target_courted.GetBestName], you've known that there is something special about [target_courted.GetHerHim]. This is no mere physical attraction but it is the pure and chaste spirit of courtly love. Some may object to such a feeling being displayed for a relative but you know you are in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4102;Actually this might be a bad idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4103;Since you have set your eyes on [target_courted.GetBestName], you've known that there is something special about [target_courted.GetHerHim]. This is no mere physical attraction but it is the pure and chaste spirit of courtly love. Some may object to such a feeling being displayed for a [target_courted.GetManWoman] of the cloth but you know you are in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4104;Since you have set your eyes on [target_courted.GetBestName], you've known that there is something special about [target_courted.GetHerHim]. This is no mere physical attraction but it is the pure and chaste spirit of courtly love. Some may object to such a feeling being displayed for a person of the same sex but you know you are in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4111;A cruel fate has taken your dear [target_courted.GetBestName] from you. Now [target_courted.GetSheHe] will never know the true depth of your devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4111;Alas!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4112;It appears that some vile villain has imprisoned your dear [target_courted.GetBestName]. Surely your letters will never reach [target_courted.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4112;I will bide my time;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4113;You receive news that your dear [target_courted.GetBestName] has fallen into a very severe state of sickness. All you can do now is wait and hope that you may be allowed again to be with [target_courted.GetHerHim] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4113;Get well soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4114;Your feelings for [target_courted.GetBestName] have recently changed into something more physical and no longer correspond to those of courtly love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4114;On to new horizons;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4115_BUSY;Your current duties leave you little time to pursue the affection of [target_courted.GetBestName]. Is this something you still wish to pursue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4115_UNAVAILABLE;In recent times, you have not been able to communicate with [target_courted.GetBestName] because of [target_courted.GetHerHis] current occupation. Are you willing to wait?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4115;You have been pursuing the affection of [target_courted.GetBestName] for a long while but [target_courted.GetSheHe] has not given signs of sharing your feelings. Is it worth continuing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4115;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4115;Maybe it's time to give up;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4120;It appears that [target_courted.GetBestName] has tired of your advances and is now refusing to see you unless in official capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4120;I should work on my technique;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4200;A Love Letter;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4200;You have received a letter from [From.GetBestName] and you are surprised at the contents. [From.GetSheHeCap] expresses [From.GetHerHis] love for you and sees you as an angelic muse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4200_CR;You have received a letter from [From.GetBestName] and you are surprised at the contents. [From.GetSheHeCap] expresses [From.GetHerHis] love for you and sees you as an angelic muse. You wonder why your [GetFromRelation] would write this to you of all people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4200;Such beautiful words!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4201;Enourage [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4200;Well [From.GetSheHe] says it's chaste...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4200;I'm not that naive;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4201;Dissuade [From.GetHerHim] with silence;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus_4200;I'm sure my [Root.GetHusbandWifeOpp] would disapprove;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE_equus_4200;This is beneath my honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4203;Show [From.GetHerHim] your disapproval;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_equus_4200;My [GetFromRelation] should know better than to contemplate such perversions;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTREFUSE_equus100;I'll keep away from [From.GetHerHim] from now on;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4201;You sent an elaborate love letter to [From.GetBestName] and now after several days you have [From.GetHerHis] reply. It looks like [From.GetSheHe] appreciates your words and would be interested in meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4201;Oh happy day!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4110;Your will continue your attempts;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4201;I don't really care that much;;;;;;;;;;
equus_SEDUCE_END_TOOLTIP;You will stop pursuing [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4202;You sent an elaborate love letter to [From.GetBestName] but after several days [From.GetSheHeCap] hasn't replied and all you can do is hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4202;I must keep trying!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4202;This is more work than I anticipated;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4203;You sent an elaborate love letter to [From.GetBestName] and now after several days you have [From.GetHerHis] reply. In [From.GetHerHis] reply, [From.GetSheHe] calls you a [GetFromRootInsult] and asks you to stop with your fancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4203;I'm sure [From.GetSheHe] will come around;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4203;I suppose I don't deserve [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4210;A Gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4210;Your maid brings you a package by [From.GetBestName]. When you open it, you find it is an exquisite necklace decorated with a cameo representing Lancelot and Guinevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4210_CR;Your maid brings you a package by [From.GetBestName]. When you open it, you find it is an exquisite necklace decorated with a cameo representing Lancelot and Guinevere. You wonder why your [GetFromRelation] would send this to you of all people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA_equus_4210;That is a wonderful gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4210;Oh I see where this is going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4211;It appears that the necklace you sent has had its effect. [From.GetBestName] lets you know that she apppreciates your choice of a cameo of Lancelot and Guinevere.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4211_M;It appears that the sword you sent has had its effect. [From.GetBestName] lets you know that he apppreciates your choice of an engraving of the story of Tristan and Iseult.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4212;It appears that the necklace you sent has failed to impress [From.GetBestName]. You have not received any acknowledgement that it has been received.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4212_M;It appears that the sword you sent has failed to impress [From.GetBestName]. You have not received any acknowledgement that it has been received.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4213;It appears that [From.GetBestName] has not appreciated the necklace you sent her. It has recently returned to you around the neck of a sow with a note asking you to desist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4213_M;It appears that [From.GetBestName] has not appreciated the sword you sent her.You see it at the belt of the servant who asks you to cease your attempts on his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4220;Friendly Advice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4220;Your maid has recently been praising [From.GetBestName] at every chance she gets. You're sure someone is trying to get your attention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4220_CR;Your maid has recently been praising [From.GetBestName] at every chance she gets. But the adjectives she uses are not those typically used for a [GetFromRelation]. You're sure someone is trying to get your attention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA_equus_4220;Oh! Well [From.GetSheHe] sounds interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4220;I'd like to better know my [GetFromRelation];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4221;It seems like the time spent with [From.GetBestName]'s servants has payed off. [From.GetSheHeCap] now has a greater eye for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4222;It seems like the time spent with [From.GetBestName]'s servants has not really payed off. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't seem to pay any more or less attention to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4223;It seems like the time spent with [From.GetBestName]'s servants has backfired. [From.GetSheHeCap] now avoids your gaze when you meet and tries to avoid meeting you in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4300;A Court Ball;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4300;You are enjoying a ball among courtiers and relatives until you notice someone else. It is [From.GetBestName] and he comes up to you asking for a dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA_equus_4300_F;Oh, certainly [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4300_CR;Oh, certainly [GetFromRelation]!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4301;Encourage [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4300;I'm sorry, someone else already asked me;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4302;Discourage [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4300_MAR;I'm afraid I already promised this dance to my [Root.GetHusbandWifeOpp];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4300_CR;I'm afraid this dance is a bit too intimate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTREFUSE_equus100;I'm tired of this pestering;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4301;You attend a ball with [From.GetBestName] and manage to dance with [From.GetHerHim]. After an exhilarating dance, you spend the evening together enjoying each other's company.

EVTDESC_equus_4301_DISTANT;You manage to travel far enough to attend a ball with [From.GetBestName] and manage to dance with [From.GetHerHim]. After an exhilarating dance, you spend the evening together enjoying each other's company. You now feel compelled to tell [From.GetHerHim] the full breadth of your feelings. Is it the right moment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4301;Yes, I need to say everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4303;You attempt to obtain a fixed relationship;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4301;No, I need to still prove myself;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIP_equus_4304;Wait for a more opportune moment;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4301;Actually, [From.GetSheHe] isn't as good as I thought [From.GetSheHe] was;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4302;You attend a ball with [From.GetBestName] and ask [From.GetHerHim] to dance with you. Unfortunately, [From.GetSheHe] refuses by citing some previous commitment and leaves you to your own devices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4302;It will take more than this to discourage me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4302;Well I guess I'm not wanted here;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4303;A Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4303;Encouraged by your reaction, [From.GetBestName] makes an empassioned speech baring [From.GetHerHis] emotions and begging you to become [From.GetHerHis] courtly muse. Will you accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4303;Oh yes [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4303;I'm afraid you misunderstood my behavior;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4303;Sure,"courtly love". I see what you're doing and I won't agree to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4303_F;I know better than to trust a [From.GetManWoman] with proposals of "pure love";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4304;The marvellous evening with [From.GetBestName] comes to an end as [From.GetSheHe] leaves you with the promise that you will meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4304;What a [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4305;Despite the wonderful time you had with [From.GetBestName], it seems like [From.GetSheHe] has lost interest in you.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4305;But, why?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4306;Encouraged by [From.GetBestName] reaction, you makes an empassioned speech baring your emotions and begging [From.GetHerHim] to become your courtly muse. After a moment's thought, [From.GetSheHe] joyfully accepts you as [From.GetHerHis] champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4306;I will serve you dutifully;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4307;Encouraged by [From.GetBestName] reaction, you makes an empassioned speech baring your emotions and begging [From.GetHerHim] to become your courtly muse.

EVTOPTA_equus_4307;I must find a way to prove myself;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4307;I understand when I'm not wanted;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4308;Encouraged by [From.GetBestName] reaction, you makes an empassioned speech baring your emotions and begging [From.GetHerHim] to become your courtly muse. [From.GetSheHeCap] laughs in your face and tells you to find some other gullible young [From.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4308;I will turn this cruel heart yet!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4308;I will not stand here and be insulted!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4351;A Church Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4351;One day, while attending mass, you notice your beloved [From.GetBestName] is also attending. This is your chance to make yourself noticed. How will you go about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4351_DISTANT;After a long journey, you attend church in the town of your beloved [From.GetBestName]. This is your chance to make yourself noticed. How will you go about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4351;I will try to catch [From.GetHerHis] gaze from a distance;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4351;I will sit close to [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4351;I will ask the priest to steer the sermon to highlight my virtues;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4352_SERMON;One day at mass, you notice the priest praising the virtues of chivalry and holy love. Shortly after, you hear him point out how [From.GetBestName] is the best example of all these qualities. Clearly [From.GetBestName] is trying to get your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4352_CLOSE;One day at mass, you find yourself accosted by [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] sits close to you on the pew. [From.GetSheHeCap] shows you more attention than you would normally expect from a casual church-goer.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4352_GAZE;One day at mass, you notice that [From.GetBestName] is casting furtive glances at you when the priest touches on the themes of divine love. The symbolism appears to be quite clear here.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4352_SERMON;[From.GetBestName] is quite the paragon;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4352_CLOSE;If only we could get closer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4352_GAZE;I will hold that gaze;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4352_SERMON;Bah, anyone can bribe a priest for that!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4352_CLOSE;Who told [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] could sit here?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4352_GAZE;[From.GetSheHeCap] should come and talk to me if [From.GetSheHe] wants anything;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4353;It seems like your attempts have failed to impress [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetSheHe] avoids you for the rest of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4354;It seems like your attempts have managed to impress [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetSheHe] accompanies you on the way out and for the rest of the day. Should you tell [From.GetHerHim] the full breadth of your emotions?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4354;Yes, it is time;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4354;Our relationship must still grow;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4354;Actually, I'm not sure what I saw in [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_equus_4401;Travelling Together;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4401;One day, you find yourself travelling to the countryside with [From.GetBestName] and offer to escort [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] accepts and you have some time to spend together. What will you talk about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4401_DISTANT;One day, you meet [From.GetBestName] returning to [From.GetHerHis] court and offer to escort [From.GetHerHim] for a part of the journey. [From.GetSheHeCap] accepts and you have some time to spend together. What will you talk about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4401;I will tell stories of knightly valor;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4401;I will talk about my recent accomplishments;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4401;I will ask news of [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4402_VALOR;While travelling with your entourage, you meet [From.GetBestName] who offers to escort you for part of the trip. In the meantime, [From.GetSheHe] passes the time by telling you stories of knightly valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4402_SELF;While travelling with your entourage, you meet [From.GetBestName] who offers to escort you for part of the trip. In the meantime, [From.GetSheHe] passes the time by telling you stories about recent accomplishments and quests [From.GetSheHe] has undertaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4402_OTHER;While travelling with your entourage, you meet [From.GetBestName] who offers to escort you for part of the trip. In the meantime, [From.GetSheHe] passes the time by asking what you have been doing since the last time you two met.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4402_VALOR;I admire knights so much;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4402_SELF;Oh my, what a talented [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4402_OTHER;How kind of you to ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4402_VALOR;I've never much understood knights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4402_SELF;When will this windbag stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4402_OTHER;I'm sure that's none of [From.GetHerHis] business;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4403;You speak for a long time with [From.GetBestName] but seem to lose [From.GetHerHis] attention often. When you go your separate ways, you can tell that [From.GetSheHe] is relieved to leave you.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4404;Your conversation with [From.GetBestName] flows freely and easily. You spend ample time talking to each other and you can clearly see that [From.GetSheHe] has greatly enjoyed the exchange. Should you tell [From.GetHerHim] the full extent of your feelings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4410;Due to the recent change in your relationship with [lost_courtly.GetBestName] you can now no longer call yourselves courtly lovers. A new chapter in the relationship now opens to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4410;I wish you well;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus_4410;I always knew there was more;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus_4410;Damn [lost_courtly.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_4412;Grave news has reached you today. Your beloved [From.GetBestName], your lover untainted by sin, has fallen ill and sent you one last letter. [From.GetSheHeCap] writes that the experiences had with you were the best anticipation of paradise [From.GetSheHe] could have wished for and hopes you will meet soon in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus_4412;Oh [From.GetFirstName]! Why did you leave me like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Book writing
EVTDESC_equus.5119;You have decided to write a poetic work with which to be remembered by posterity. You now have many choices to face to decide in which direction this work will go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5119;I am ready;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5120;The first issue you will have to face is the matter of the theme of your work. On what will it center?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5120;The praise of God;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.5120;My experience of courtly love;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.5120;The virtues of the head of my order;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.5120;The virtues of knights;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5121;The writing of your poetic work has continued well in the last months and you are ready to show a first draft. Who will you choose to advise you in this matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5121;A fellow knight;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.5121;A dear friend;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.5121;A courtier;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5122;As your poetic work is nearing completion, you find that the final touches will require as much attention as you can dedicate to them. How much time are you willing to dedicate?;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5122;I won't come out until it's perfect;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.5122;I will spend most of my days writing;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.5122;I will find time in between my many duties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_5124_GOOD;You look upon the poetic work you have been laboring over and you find it to be excellent. You are sure that it will be praised far and wide. Do you want to publish it?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_5124_MEH;You look upon the poetic work you have been laboring over and you find it to be acceptable. You think it will be well received among your peers. Do you want to publish it?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus_5124_BAD;You look upon the poetic work you have been laboring over and you find it to be terrible. You think you will be laughed at if anyone will read it. Do you want to publish it?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5124;I will release it to the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.5124;I would rather keep it to myself;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5126;Soon after you receive the illuminated manuscript of your poetic work, you find innumerable letters from scholars and nobles praising your literary skill. Already now, monks all over Europe are working hard to pass your work on to posterity.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5126;It was worth all the work!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5127;After publishing your poetic work, you receive some letters from fellow knights who praise your style and choice of theme. Most scholars won't notice your work but it seems to have impressed your peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5127;That was good enough;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5128;You carefully lock away the pages of your manuscript as you wonder if they may yet come in handy some day. For now, you will not be publishing anything anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5128;Until next time;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.5129;After publishing your poetic work, you receive no letters but rather you hear of scholars and some fellow knights openly mocking your text as the product of a lazy pretentious noble.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.5129;I should have never started this mess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#Finding your heirloom
EVTDESC_equus.6254;You have heard a rumor from the country around your home that an ancient heirloom of your family might be somewhere in the countryside. Do you want to plan a search?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.6254;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.6254;I have more important things to do;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6255;The information you gained from rumors is still not enough to run an effective search. How will you find more information?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.6255;I will gather information from those who live in the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.6255;I will search all the books I can find;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.6255;I will steal information from my enemies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_equus.6255;I will send my squire to gather information;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6256s;The information you obtained has proved very useful and you find yourself on the right path. However, you notice a hungry looking beast standing in your way.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6256f;You haven't been able to obtain any meaningful information so you head out into the forest to search for clues. While you are so occupied, you notice a fierce beast making its way towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.6256;I will attack the creature;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.6256;I will send my squire to weaken it for me;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.6256;I will hide and avoid the beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6257s;You manage to get past the monster and be on your way. After a few hours of travel, you come upon a ruin with crumbled indications that you have indeed found the right place. But where is the artifact kept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6257f;You barely manage to escape from the monster and proceed into the woods with several cuts and bruises. After a few hours of travel, you come upon a ruined old building that seems to be what you seek. But where is the artifact kept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.6257;I will take down every wall I can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.6257;I will look for guidance in the symbolism of the place;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_equus.6257;I will study the architecture for hidden chambers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6258bw;You triumphantly enter the dark crypt and notice the telltale glint of gold. You manage to find an ancient ring with the initials of [ancestor.GetBestName] and some extra loot for your trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6258pw;You enter the dark crypt and notice a glint of precious metal in the dirt. Scraping it away, you manage to find an ancient ring with the initials of [ancestor.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6258l;You have been looking for a couple of days now and you can't find anything. Maybe you can't find the artifact or you went to the wrong place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_equus.6258dl;You have been looking for a couple of days now in terrible weather and you can't find anything. Maybe you can't find the artifact or you went to the wrong place. The defeat stings and you're not feeling too good either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_equus.6258;Another job well done;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_equus.6258;This was not worth my time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
