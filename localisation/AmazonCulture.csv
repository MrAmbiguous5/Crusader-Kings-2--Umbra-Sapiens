EVTTITLAmzCul.101;Rise of the Amazons?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.101;Fortune favours the bold, and what bolder course of action could one individual take than to radically upend the social order?\n With the rulership under feminine control, the opportunity presents itself to make this unlikely situation a more permanent arrangement. To have this opportunity pass me by - to deny myself and my sisters of purpose and power - would be to squander what might be the only chance to enact real change. \nRome wasn't built in a day, nor should I expect such sweeping reforms to be embraced immediately. Only once I have gathered enough support among my people will we truly witness the fruits of this monumental labour...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.101;We shall be silent no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.10199;The Age of Kings is at an end. \nAs droves of new citizens flock to the capital, [Root.Culture.GetName] norms take firm root in the nation's heart. Our military reforms have seen an increase in potential recruits with a unique ethos favourable to the [Root.Culture.GetName] cause, and a number of vassals have already instituted the reforms I put forward at the outset of this endeavour. \n\nWe are stable, for now, but will such an achievement be viewed merely as a fleeting experiment in rulership... or as the prelude to greatness?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.120;A mysterious man answers my challenge, swaggering into court with a confident stride. He introduces himself as [invited_suitor.GetDynName], a traveller and vagabond from a distant land in search of adventure. He casually claims to have slain many men, bedded countless women, and sired innumerable bastards throughout his life. Hearing of my challenge, he says he jumped at the opportunity to claim an Amazonian [Root.GetTitle] as his most recent conquest. \nI look him up and down, studying him carefully. Could I beat him in a fight? Would I be willing to let him bed me if he emerges victorious?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.121;Our match begins anon. I lead [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] to a secluded area where a waiting servant offers me a sword. "First blood?" I ask my challenger, inquiring as to the nature of our duel. \n"Until disarmed, I think," [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] grins lecherously. "I wouldn't wish to damage such fine meat." \nI ignore the comment for now and take my place opposite him. He draws his own sword, slow and deliberate, his attentive gaze never leaving me for one second. \nAll this attention gives me an idea. The man is clearly fascinated by what he sees. Perhaps I could use this to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.121;"Don't worry, [invited_suitor.GetFirstName]. You won't.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.121;Do something scandalous. Flash your ankle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.122;I close the distance between us in an instant. As he brings his weapon up to block me, I dart left to right to left again before striking with an overhead attack. My blade cuts only air as [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] evades my strike. But rather than counterattack, he slaps me on the backside with the flat of his sword! Enraged, I lunge for his neck with a wide swing only for him to swat my blade away. I struggle to maintain my grip. \n"Careful, [Root.GetTitle]," [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] teases. "Looks like you might have a case of the butterfingers." \nWithout realising, the fool has left himself open to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.122;Quickly punch him in the face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.122;Seductively suck on your finger. "Is this better?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.123;[invited_suitor.GetFirstName]'s sudden nosebleed catches him by surprise. I take advantage of this distraction and attack. Not fast enough, it seems, as my challenger brings his sword up to meet mine. Our blades sing with a clash of steel and fill the air with the buzz of anticipation, waiting for a winner to emerge victorious. This man clearly wasn't lying about his prowess with a weapon. He's a skilled duelist for sure, but whether he's better than an Amazonian [Root.GetTitle] remains to be seen. \n"You're working up quite the sweat, [Root.GetFirstName]," he remarks. "Do let me know if you wish to submit.";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.125a;Ducking low beneath his swing, I ram my shoulder into [invited_suitor.GetFirstName]'s centre of mass and knock him to the ground. I place my blade against his throat before he can get back up. \n\nReluctantly, as the reality of his situation settles in, my challenger tosses aside his sword. He smiles, throws his hands up in surrender, and accepts his defeat. "I am yours to command, Amazonian.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.125b;Countering his swing with a devious backhand, I manage to leap behind him before kicking in his knees. [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] drops to the ground as I slide my sword under his chin. "Drop it!" I growl. \n\nHesitating longer than I'd like, he eventually releases his grip on his sword and tosses it to the side. "I am yours to command, Amazonian.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.125;"Yes. Yes you are.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.126a;I go to slide my sword under his defence but he suddenly catches the blade in his crossguard, locking our two swords together. Without skipping a beat, [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] pulls me in close, lifts me up and throws me into the ground. \n\nWinded, I'm helpless to resist as my arms are pinned into the small of my back! He tears a strip of cloth from my sleeve and binds my wrists with startling ease. \n"Are you ready to submit now?" he taunts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.126b;Just when I think I have the measure of his strength, [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] surprises me. With a slash far stronger than I'd expected from him, he manages to knock the sword clean from my hands. If that wasn't bad enough, he marks his sudden victory by painting his blade across my torso in a lightning quick flourish. At first I think nothing of it, but then my clothes suddenly fall apart and gather around my ankles in a shredded heap! I move to cover what remains of my dignity as fast as I can, though the damage is done. \n\n"Butterfingers, indeed," he laughs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.126;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.127a;The hours roll by. I retire to my chamber for the evening, dragging [invited_suitor.GetFirstName] by the hand to claim my prize.

He casually claims to have slain many men, bedded countless women, and sired innumerable bastards throughout his life. Hearing of the existence of an Amazonian [Root.GetTitle], he curiously sought me out to ask if the stories were true - that Amazonian women will only bed men strong enough to defeat them in a duel. Before I can correct him, he announces his candidacy as a challenger. \nI say, "That's not true...

EVTDESCAmzCul.301;I journey into the woodland to find the reclusive huntress who resides here. After many hours, I eventually find her in a clearing hunched over a fresh kill, a single arrow protruding from deep between the beast's ribs. Despite my careful approach, she marks my presence with an uncanny sense of awareness and draws her bow on me the instant I emerge from behind a tree. \n"Pardon my intrusion," I hastily say. "I heard this was the place where-" \n"You heard right," she cuts in, levelling her aim squarely between eyes. She gets the measure of me with a predatory gaze. My blood runs cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.3011;I react just quickly enough that the arrowhead only grazes me and buries itself in a tree some distance away. A trickle of blood spills down my cheek. \n"Then leave me to my hunt, pup," the huntress growls. "The next arrow won't be a warning shot.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3011;"I'll be going now.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.302;"You believe you have what it takes?" the huntress asks. I nod my head - I wouldn't have sought her out otherwise. The huntress slowly releases the tension in her bow. "Good," she says. "I've been expecting you." She plucks the arrow from the beast's chest and slips it back into her quiver. "Your first task is simple. Carry this beast back to my camp. And don't fall behind. These woods are dangerous at night." \nWith that, the huntress turns around and starts off in the opposite direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.302;"I will not fail you!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.302;It doesn't look too heavy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAmzCul.302;"I'm not your damn errand girl.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.3022;The huntress rounds on me instantly. "You're fortunate that you *are* a girl," she barks, unsheathing a razor-sharp skinning knife from her waist. "Fewer bits to slice off. Now get out of my sight before I decide to take your tongue instead!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3022;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.303;I make it to the huntress' camp just as night rolls in. The woods grow eerily dark beyond the light of the campfire before my very eyes. I throw the dead beast down beside the fire and sigh in relief to finally be rid of its heft. "Alright, what's next?" \nA long moment passes before the huntress replies. "Tell me, girl," she whispers, glancing up from the fire, "why do you wish to learn the ways of the Amazon?" \nThe question catches me off guard, but the answer comes to me suddenly. It was so obvious that I speak with newfound certainty. "I wish to claim my birthright." \nThe huntress nods. "Then tonight, you shall claim it." She produces a long strip of cloth and holds it outstretched. "Cover your eyes.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.303;I'm not afraid of the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.303;Best do as she says.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAmzCul.303;"I don't feel comfortable with this.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.3033;The huntress retracts her arm, her demeanour suddenly turning cold. "Comfort is a luxury few in this world can afford. Fewer still who refuse to claim what is theirs by right of birth. Begone, pup.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3033;"What? Now? But it's so dark...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.304;Blindfolding myself, my senses are soon restricted to what I can hear and smell. In front of me there is a sharp crackling of the campfire, to my right, the soft crunch of old leaves underfoot as the huntress rises from her seat. The scent of smoke wafts all around and the metallic stench of the beast's bloodstains on my clothing confronts my nostrils. "Drink," her voice commands. I'm unsure what that means until I feel the press of a wooden bowl against my lips and a warm liquid invades my mouth. I recognise the taste as a mixture of milk and honey, though it seems to be laced with something strange and unfamiliar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.304;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.304;Drink it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAmzCul.304;Spit it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.3044;"Aargh! It's in my eye!" the huntress roars. She punches me firmly in the gut and I collapse, gasping for air. \nBy the time I remove the blindfold, I find myself lying alone in the dark beside a pit of faintly glowing embers. Somewhere nearby, a wolf howls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3044;*gulp*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.305;A moment passes and my head begins to swirl uncontrollably, and I fear losing my balance as well as my lunch before the huntress steadies me. "Focus," she commands. I allow myself to concentrate as the dizziness subsides. I soon become aware of my heart beating rhythmically in my chest, the cool sweat forming inside my clenched palms, and the steady flow of air filling my lungs with each breath. Beyond the camp, nocturnal creatures whisper dark secrets to themselves. The huntress presses a bow into my hand and a single arrow into the other. \n"Your prey awaits," she says, spinning me around and ushering me forward. \n"What am I hunting?" I ask. \n"It'll be obvious," the huntress replies. "It'll be hunting you too.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.305;"Ah, yes! The thrill of the hunt!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.305;Steel my resolve and start walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAmzCul.305;"But I'm a pacifist!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.3055;"There are only two sorts of women in this life," the huntress growls, snatching the bow from my hand. "Predator and prey. If you refuse to be the former, you resign yourself to the latter." \nI remove my blindfold to explain myself but find the huntress inexplicably vanished. I wait by the campfire until morning arrives before heading back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3055;"Pacifism is the only ethical choice, though.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.306;A misleading sense of peace envelopes me as I make my way deeper into the woods, but I know I'm far from safe. Every sound, however insignificant, catches my attention. I realise I'm acutely aware of things that would usually escape my notice. An owl glides stealthily overhead. A small lizard darts for cover under a rock. I can hear the heartbeats of every living thing around me and smell them on the breeze. I exist as one with nature, indivisible. When I hear breathing nearby, my first assumption is that the huntress is tailing me. Upon closer assessment I also hear the soft patter of four distinct paws, each tipped in an arsenal of deadly claws. A primal fear runs down my spine. \nIt's a wolf!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.306;Remain quiet. Silence is a weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.306;Growl at it to show dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.307;The wolf is circling me. It knows I'm here. And it knows I'm alone. \nI nock my sole arrow in anticipation. \nThe beast pauses, lowering itself closer to the ground. It's moments away from attacking. \nMy instincts are screaming at me to do something!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.307;Take aim!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.307;RUN!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.3077;I turn tail and make for the campsite, running as fast as my legs will carry me. Branches swipe at my face as I beat a hasty retreat. But four legs are better than two. I hear a vicious snarl moments before a jaw full of fangs closes around the scruff of my neck. Blood wells in the back of my throat. My cry of pain turns into a gargle as the wolf tosses me around like a ragdoll. Just then, I hear the twang of a bowstring and the thud of an arrow. The wolf loosens its stranglehold on my neck and collapses on top of me, dead in an instant. \n"What a waste," the huntress mutters. The dissatisfied tone of her voice is the least of my concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.3077;Ow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.308;I draw back my arrow halfway, the shaft scraping steadily against the bow's grip. My pulse beats like a war drum inside my skull. I only get one shot at this, and a miss means certain death. My senses suddenly flare as I hear the wolf launch into its charge. My mind counts down. \n3... \n2... \n1...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.308;SHOOT  IT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAmzCul.308;STAB  IT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLAmzCul.309;The Hunt Concludes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.309;I awaken some time later, warmed by the rising sun. I peel away the bloodied blindfold and shield my eyes from the burning light. "What happened?" I ask aloud. \nNobody replies. There's no sign of the huntress anywhere. \nLying beside me is the body of a huge wolf, it's jet black fur tainted with a crimson sheen. A single arrow juts out from above its collarbone. It would appear I skewered it at the same moment it knocked me unconscious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.309;A worthy foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Giant Kings ruled the known world from atop their ziggurats, worshipped and feared in equal measure, until humanity could suffer the yoke of oppression no more. Zahara Ishtar, the first Amazonian, bravely slew the God-King Nirgal atop the Ha-Mazan temple and set in motion a rebellion that would see the race of Giants all but eradicated. Zahara was betrayed by her allies, relegating the Amazonians to the annals of myth and legend, and the threat of the Giants was lost to history, forgotten. \nNow they have returned, prepared to once again plunge the world into the darkness of their shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.401;One of my sergeants appears before me with a young woman in tow, bound at the wrists and looking the worse for wear. The sergeant explains that a routine patrol was ambushed by a group of bandits last night. All outlaws were slain, except for this young woman who surrendered the moment all her companions laid dead or dying. Before I can pass judgement, the captive suddenly throws herself at my feet with tears streaming down her cheeks. \n"Please forgive my crimes, O venerable [Root.GetTitle]. Those damned brigands kidnapped me when I was but a child and forced me to fight for them. I had no choice! You must believe me! I would pledge my life and my blade to your service... if you would grant me amnesty.";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAmzCul.501;"Amazonian!" \nI stop what I'm doing and look around the market square when a brawny old man shoves his way forward. \n"C'mere and let me show you what a proper *man* can do with his sword!" He wildly swings his weapon in a flourish before launching at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.501;"Very well. Lay on!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.502;I sidestep the first strike and duck under the next with practised ease. When I clobber the old man over the head with the flat of my blade, he crumples to the ground and curls up into a tight ball. \n"Please!" he screams. "Have mercy!";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAAmzCul.505;"I just want everyone to be aware... you started this.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.506;I kick the wooden leg out from under him and he loses his balance. Once he's lying on the ground, I plant the heel of my boot against his throat. An audience of townspeople looks on with avid interest, waiting to see what I do next. Two options cross my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAAmzCul.507;"That was... unwise.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.508;The old man and I draw our blades in unison - though with so many parts missing, he doesn't prove too successful at swordplay.

EVTOPTAAmzCul.509;"You do realise I am the [Root.GetTitle], right?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.510;A look of abject horror washes over the old man's face. He stumbles over a few unintelligible words before he can finally piece a coherent sentence together. "Listen," he says softly, "about all those things I said..." I'm so drawn in by his stupidity that I don't notice his hand reaching behind his back. "I meant every word."

I feel the cold sting of metal glide through the skin at my neck, a short spray of blood following in the blade's wake. The old man lunges at me a second time, slicing low to graze my abdomen, but I'm quick enough to avoid being gutted. My hand gropes for the wound at my throat as the crowd screams around me. \n"Die, Amazonian!" the old man roars, slashing with astonishing speed and dexterity. "Taste my sword and die!" \nIgnoring that he has a dagger and not a sword, I reach for my scabbard and draw my own. Steel sings as blades clash, and I soon have the old man on the retreat. I press the advantage and back him into a corner before impaling my blade through his one good arm. \n"Just you wait, harlot!" he groans. "I'll get you one of these days!";;;;;;;;;;;;x

All except for one. \n"Ahh," the merchant beams, his one gold tooth sparkling, "you like what you see? An exile from a faraway land. Very exotic. Very strong! Too strong for you maybe." He laughs. \nThe slave in question is indeed something of a curiosity to me. A fine physique, muscular arms, and a woman to boot! She watches me as closely as I watch her and I think, if not for the heavy irons clamped around her wrists, she could strike me down where I stand. "How much for this one?" \n"Oh, she's expensive."

EVTDESCAmzCul.701;I dreamt of a battle last night. A war raging across a golden beach, shadowed by the marble pillars of ancient monuments. I fought with spear and shield in a phalanx as a fleet of chariots carved swathes through the enemy ranks. They had brought the war to us, I knew. But as the sun went down, only my sisters and I remained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.701;Sisters? What?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.702;I found myself at sea during a violent storm. Fleets of ships were locked in deadly embrace as the waves turned red with the blood of our enemies. I leapt from deck to deck with my shieldsisters and slaughtered all who stood in my way. Where I swung my axe, death followed. I was indomitable. Then an arrow pierced my heart... and I woke up in my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.702;I was enjoying that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.703;I dreamt of riding over verdant plains, the wind in my hair. I rode with a team of fellow huntresses as we stalked our prey. We tracked the prints across rivers and mountains, inching ever closer to our mark. The campfire gave him away at a distance. He heard us coming and ran, but he couldn't outrun me. I sent an arrow through his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.703;What a weird dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.704;A thousand ironshod hooves thundered around me. Our spears were couched, our aim precise. I joined my voice to the chorus of warcries as the enemy braced for impact. They locked their shields in a tight formation - a 'testudo', they called it. But we were many, my sisters and I, and we were ever so quick. We carved them apart like a hot knife through butter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.704;Wait. That was just a DREAM?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.705;I gaze out across a silent desert, moonlight painting the sand in a silver glow. Colossal pyramids dominate the horizon and a river of shimmering gold cleaves through the land. This was our empire, the homeland of my foremothers. We were rich, once, with wealth beyond imagining. I wake up suddenly with tears in my eyes. Why was I dreaming that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.705;It felt so real.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.706;Our ship grinds to a halt upon the sands of an empty shore. "Do you see it, too?" our princess asks.

EVTOPTAAmzCul.706;I wake up suddenly, the taste of seasalt on my lips.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.707;In my dream, I stand atop a peak looking out across a fertile valley. This is my home - a fort among the mountain cliffs. People say our home is impenetrable, but I can't escape this uneasy feeling that our time is limited. When I look to the south, I see a great golden eagle flying above a red snake. The snake slithers ever closer, its iron scales rippling in the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.707;That was odd.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.708;I stand atop a white cliff overlooking the ocean, a fleet of transport ships carving through the surf far below. They came back, just like they said they would. Just as the druids warned. I sense an unnatural stillness in the air, a foreboding realisation that our time is limited. They've come to conquer us, to colonise. Andraste save us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAmzCul.708;What? Who's Andraste?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCul.709;The salty air fills my senses as our ship crashes through another wave. My purse is brimming with loot, each valuable trinket most violently acquired. Our banner sails high above the mast as a harbinger of doom for wherever the winds take us next. I spy our widow queen at the figurehead - a more dangerous beauty there never was. Then I wake up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLAmzCal.920;The Forgotten Line;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmzCal.920;The Prophet, peace be upon Him, had but one child to survive infancy, a daughter. Fatimah bint Muhammad - known also as Fatimah al-Zahra, 'The Lady of Light' - mothered a number of sons from whom many Muslims still claim patrilineal descent today. \nBut Fatimah also had two daughters, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum, whose direct lines back to the Prophet were never afforded the same respect and veneration as their cousins. Such willful erasures of Prophetic geneaology are a disgrace to Muslims the world over, born from selfish disdain for the fairer sex. \nThis ignorance does, however, present an opportunity. If a certain [Root.GetTitle] were to provide evidence of her matrilineal descent from either of Fatimah's daughters, her claim might finally put an end to the sectarian violence that has plagued Islam for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

None can deny the implications of this new finding, and already the mosques have begun spreading the word throughout the Islamic world. \nLet it be known that the pedigree of the Prophet's family is no longer limited to the sons of sons of sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_203;I'm spending time at the Hall and basking in the atmosphere of casual alcoholism as my fellow members regale us with tales of their exploits when a kinswoman of mine, [From.GetFirstName], suddenly appears next to me. \n"Sister!" she begins, slapping me hard on the back. "What say you to a friendly wager? A challenge? Your speed against mine. First one to the peak of Blackrock Mountain wins a hefty sum of coin from the loser. Agree?" \nMy kinswoman's suggestion has garnered the attention of several others who now await my answer. Turning to face her, I say...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_203;"Perhaps another time.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_205;[mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] throws her head back in laughter. "Another time? Ha! I knew it!" She slaps me on the back again and swaggers off, laughing all the while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_205;How embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_204;We stand together at the foot of the mountain, humbled by its immensity. The craggy rock extends so far into the sky that the peak is lost amongst the clouds. It occurs to me that I may have bitten off more than I can chew with this challenge, but it's too late to back down now. Looking to [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] - and the beads of sweat forming on her brow - I imagine she's having similar regrets. \n"There's no time like the present," I say. "Shall we?" \n"Ready when you are.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_204;"3... 2... 1... Go!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_206;The journey is rough, the path a steep climb over almost vertical cliffs. I leave behind a trail of blood as my fingers are shredded by bladed stones. Every muscle burns with exhaustion, every joint begging for respite. The only thing keeping me going is the knowledge that [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] is here with me as we tackle this challenge together. Over time, I begin to lose sight of the winner's purse - the knowledge that I'd beaten this mountain all the reward I need. \nIt takes many hours of gruelling labour, but as the sun sets on our climb and the distant ground vanishes into the gloom, we finally reach the plateau.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_206;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_207;"Thanks," I say, accepting [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName]'s purse. Looking around the plateau, it's much larger than I'd imagined. The terrain is rough, yet relatively flat, with a handful of boulders and spires dispersed throughout. The gravelly soil crunches beneath my feet. \nWe collapse in unison, lying on our backs as starlight twinkles above us like a thousand tiny candles. At long last, I can rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_207;Zzzzzzz...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_208;"Congratulations," I say, tossing [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] a small purse. Looking around the plateau, it's much larger than I'd imagined. The terrain is rough, yet relatively flat, with a handful of boulders and spires dispersed throughout. The gravelly soil crunches beneath my feet. \nWe collapse in unison, lying on our backs as starlight twinkles above us like a thousand tiny candles. At long last, I can rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_208;Zzzzzzz...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_209;We're awoken from our slumbers by an earth-shattering rumble and a growl so penetrating that it makes my blood run cold with a primal dread. I jolt upright, grasping instinctively for a weapon only to realise that I didn't bring one with me. \nI can hardly believe what I'm seeing as an enormous reptilian beast emerges from the shadows, eyes glowing amber above a phalanx of deadly fangs. It bounds ever closer, ground quaking as it approaches, and unfolds its leathery wings in a menacing canopy that blots out the stars before unleashing a deafening roar. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_209;Uh-oh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_210;The creature rears its serpentine neck, inhaling with a sharp hiss. Only as the embers begin to pour from between its teeth do I realise my imminent peril. I leap out of the way just in time, taking cover behind a boulder as a lance of golden flame sweeps the ground where I was standing. The heat alone singes my skin with the intensity of a thousand blast furnaces and, as the fire engulfs everything in its path, even the boulder itself begins to grow distressingly warm. \nThrough the flames, I catch the briefest glimpse of [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] fleeing back down the slope.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_210;"Wait for me!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_210;"Well, I guess it's up to [Root.GetFirstName] to stop the monster...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_211;Returning to the Hall, [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] and I tell of our encounter with the fire-breathing monster, yet nobody believes us despite our soot-covered clothing and clear burns. Our shield-sisters instead believe it all a hoax, unsure whether to consider us cowards for having fled the imaginary beast or liars for having concocted the idea in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_211;I know what I saw.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_212;Refusing to accept a fiery death at the hands of an overgrown lizard, I search for a weapon. Everything around me is either engulfed in flame or completely incinerated, and there's little in the way of sticks to fashion a spear at this altitude. \nJust then, in a convenient moment of storytelling, I notice something glinting just under the surface of roasted gravel beside me. Plucking it out of the ground, I'm astonished to discover a chipped sword speckled with rust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_212;Better than nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_213;I bide my time for the perfect moment to strike, holding my breath as the edges of the boulder sizzle and melt away. Finally, the creature's flame dissipates and I seize on the opportunity. Gripping the old sword in both hands, I launch myself over the boulder and charge the beast. It hisses, inhaling, preparing another attack, but I prove quicker. I run my sword into the centre of its chest, burying the blade up to the hilt with all my strength, and twist. The creature howls in pain - a cry more blood-curdling I've never heard - and crumples in a mass of scales and charred flesh. I pull the sword from its chest, the metal now imbued with a curious violet glow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_213;Nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_214;With the beast slain, I take the time to explore the plateau. The wasteland is barren, void of any kind of life. Not even weeds have taken root in this inhospitable land. \nI'm about to call it a day and head back down when I happen across what appears to be a nest formed from the molten remains of a hoard of treasure, most of the gold and silver coins fused together. Only the jewels such as the diamonds, sapphires and emeralds remain largely intact. Hidden amongst the mass of treasure, safely tucked away with deliberate care, is a large scaled egg. There's too much to carry with me, so I'll need to decide between the two what to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_214;Take the riches. The egg is probably just a weird rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_214;Take the egg. Who know's what's inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_215;I burst through the entrance to the Hall, covered in soot from head to toe and red in the face, but alive. \n"You're alive?!" [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] exclaims. "I thought you were dead! I feared that creature roasted you!" \n"Fear not," I respond with a wink. "I vanquished the beast with this here sword and took for myself a prize. It'll take more than a flying lizard to kill [Root.GetDynName]."\n"Not [Root.GetDynName]," [mountain_challenger_target.GetFirstName] says. "[Root.GetFirstName] the Brave!" \nStaring meaningfully into the distance, I nod my head. "I like the sound of that.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_215;Then everyone clapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_504;The room was cleared in seconds, tables and chairs shoved aside and the floor laid bare, our shield-sisters forming a ring around us. Both of us were handed a spear and iron roundshield off the wall, then we were immediately about our bloody business. \n[grandmistress_target.GetFirstName] launches at me without hesitation, sailing through the air. I raise my shield to meet her just as the point strikes, denting through to the inside of my shield and ringing it like a bell. I swipe at her legs only for her to deftly hop out of the way before bashing her shield into my flank. She's quick, but so am I, and neither of us manage to land more than a superficial blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_504;"Stand still, dammit!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_504;"Enough! I give up!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_505;I cover my face before [grandmistress_target.GetFirstName] can strike again and shout it louder. "No more!" \nThe Grandmistress lowers her weapon, regarding me with equal parts pity and disgust as a chorus of boos erupts all around me. She slaps my hand aside. "You dare to challenge me only to cower like a frightened rat?! Such a performance is unbefitting of your rank, [Root.GetFirstName]. Your presence is an affront to our creed and an insult to our honour. You should never have been allowed to step foot inside this Hall... and nor shall you ever again. Henceforth, you are exiled. Leave now, lest you taint this Hall further with your corpse.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_505;I yet live, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_506;Minutes pass, though it could have easily been hours. My senses are consumed by the taste of blood... and I'm not entirely sure whose it is. \n[grandmistress_target.GetFirstName] matches me move for move, blow for blow. I feel my spear glance against her, slicing flesh, and see the drops of blood splashing the ground, yet she refuses to surrender. She comes at me again, harder and stronger, exacting revenge wherever I fail to defend. \nIt is indeed a rare delight to battle against one so evenly-matched. Few enemies have survived this long against me. Fewer still, I imagine, against one such as the Grandmistress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_506;"Just accept you've lost!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_507;Time rolls on. Where once our shield-sisters filled the Hall with their raucous cheers, now they watch with bated breath. My lungs burn as my battered shield grows heavy. Sweat drips down my forehead and stings my eyes. What started as a duel for power has devolved into a fight for survival. \nExhaustion is taking its toll on the Grandmistress, too. I hear her panting and see the quick rise and fall of her shoulders as she struggles to catch a breath. Her footwork grows sloppier, telegraphing her incoming strikes more carelessly. Yet still I barely manage to defend against them. Never before have I taxed my body to such an extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_507;"You're only delaying the inevitable!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_508;A flash of steel. A decisive strike. A spray of blood. \nA shield crashes to the ground. A spear slips from shaking fingers. \nA Heroine falls to her knees. \nThe duel arrives at its bloody conclusion. Only one woman is walking away from this fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_509;Through the bloodlust clouding my mind, the chanting of my shield-sisters slowly brings me back to reality. \n"[Root.GetFirstName]! [Root.GetFirstName]!

She looks up at me with a vacant expression, no doubt wondering how all this came to be. \nBefore I know it, I'm standing over her with a large battle-axe in my hands. \n"Please..."

Therefore, I have decided to embark on a personal Quest to prove the name of [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] - a Quest so glorious and memorable that every daughter of the Hall shall be honoured by my legacy.

I go to grab a quick ale before I leave, feeling as if this whole quest thing is pointless, when the tavern keeper notices me and leans in close.

He flicks through the pages one at a time. "Here's a few what might be of interest. I've got a bounty on a cult leader, word of strange apparitions in the Bay of Biscay, and a search for the owner of a glass slipper. Take your pick. Oh, and a letter... addressed to you, miss. How did that get here?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_6001;"What's this about a cult?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_6001;"Apparitions in the Bay of Biscay? You have my attention, sir.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_6001;"A glass slipper? That sounds mighty uncomfortable.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AmzCulSoc_6001;"A letter? Addressed to me? How curious.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
heroine_quest_select_tt;You choose your Quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_6002;"Back again, miss?" The old tavernkeep greets me with a smile. "Fancy an ale to wet your whistle? Or perhaps you're hoping to set off on another one of your adventures?" He ducks behind the counter and reproduces his crusty ledger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_6002;"You mentioned something about a bounty on a cultist?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_6002;"I want to know more about those apparitions in the Bay of Biscay.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_6002;"Has anyone found the owner of that glass slipper yet?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_AmzCulSoc_6002;"Didn't you have a letter for me?";;;;;;;;;;;;x

skip_heroine_adventure_tt;Spend 45 days travelling and skip the quest story, returning home as the quest concludes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_603;He tears a page from his ledger and hands it to me. The paper is brittle and yellowed with age, and the ink has smudged so as to be near illegible. I shrug, not sure what I'm meant to be reading. The tavernkeep nods knowingly. \n"I was but a young lad when I took that down. 'Twas a travelling knight what shared the tale. Covered in blood he was, and treading it all across the floor. He downed a full flagon of ale that evening, but no amount could stop his hands from shaking. I still remember that look in his eyes, I do - that cold, lifeless stare. Didn't feel right to ask him to pay for the ale." The tavernkeep pauses for a moment. "Truth be told, miss, I've not had a good night's sleep ever since. My dreams are full of visions.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_603;"Visions? Of what?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_604;"Evil," the tavernkeep replies, and it seems for a moment the entire room falls silent. He snatches the page out of my hand and shoves it back into his ledger. "The cult is holed up in an abandoned hillfort some miles yonder. They've been ambushing travellers passing through the mountains for years. Merchant caravans, patrols, noble retinues. Even armies. Few who venture that pass ever return, and those who do are never the same again. The leader of the cult is a right madman, said to worship ancient gods that would make even [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] shudder in fear. Legend is, he sacrifices young maidens to his dark gods who grant him the strength of a hundred men in return." The tavernkeep leans in closer. "They say he can't be killed.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_604;To slay such a man - if he is a man - would be legendary indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_skip;Just give me the damned bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_605;I'm looking over the maps and trying to plot the best journey through the mountains when a knock on the door steals my attention. An unlikely pair stands lingering in the hall outside my chambers. \n"Pardon, Heroine," one of my guests says. I recognise her as a fellow member of the Hall, a young fighter with a promising future ahead of her. "We heard you were planning on launching an attack against the cult." \nThe other woman steps forward. Hers is another face I know, a low-ranking courtier among the stewards. "We also hear you're planning on doing it alone and wished to offer our support. We've... both lost family to those bastards.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_605;"Then we shall have a Legendary Gathering of three!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_606;We set off early in the morning and make great strides into the cult's territory with each passing day. My young steward has proven to be invaluable in this regard. Her skills in cartography have easily cut days off this quest and paths I thought inaccessible have been navigated with ease as a result of her assistance. I expect to find her a nice office when we return home to court. The three of us ride by day and make camp by night. Our shield-sister regales us with anecdotes of her fights that she acts out with theatric detail. I suspect much of it is embellished, if not outright false, but the delivery is too entertaining to deny. And while I sleep, I dream of all our adventures yet to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_606;Tomorrow awaits...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_607;It's late in the evening when we chance upon the wreckage. We dismount some distance away and approach with caution, swords drawn. The carriage is peppered with arrows and stained with rusty hues of blood. The corpses of the two draft horses lie limp in their yokes, cleanly decapitated, though their heads are nowhere to be found. I hold my breath and peer inside the carriage, expecting to find more bodies. No bodies, just blood. Lots of it. And it's still wet. \n"I see smoke," my shield-sister says. "Beyond the next crest. Might be worth investigating." \n"Too close to be a coincidence," my young steward infers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_607;"Follow me. Ready yourselves.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_608;We stick to the shadows on our approach. The path is faint and narrow, but my shield-sister points out that a large group has been through here recently. "You see?" she whispers. "The dust isn't yet settled. And there! Drag marks. At least three separate. One of them was still alive." \nThe path widens as we climb and it's not long until we find the ruinous hillfort the tavernkeep described. The entrance appears heavily guarded, but I know looks can be deceiving. Guards are not so motionless as that. I signal for my companions to stay close behind me as we sneak closer under cover of darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_608;Sshhhhh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_609;I was right about the guards, though I wish it were otherwise. The entrance is lined with rotting heads impaled on pikes, some reduced to bones and all a feast for the crows. We pass below the portcullis and find ourselves in a courtyard. The stench of death is even heavier here. As my eyes adjust to the sudden darkness, I begin to see why. Headless bodies are strewn all around, swaying in gibbets and hanging crucified from poles. It's with a queasy sinking feeling that I realise the gravity of the situation I now find myself in. This cult doesn't kill because they need to - they kill because they enjoy it. \n"Intruders!" a voice cries from above. We've been spotted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_609;"To arms!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_610;Heavy doors on the opposite end of the courtyard suddenly burst open and unleash a torrent of cultists garbed in dark robes. They come at us without hesitation, swinging their crude iron weapons and screaming death. I take point and lean into their charge, slicing the first cultist from navel to neck. My shield-sister brings up my flank and severs a man's arm before taking the head of another. Her style complements mine remarkably well. It's as if we've been fighting side-by-side since birth. Together we carve a bloody swathe through the villainous ranks and leave the dead and dying in our wake. As the last of them falls, I turn to my companions and sigh with relief. My steward's eyes widen. \n"Look out!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_610;?!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_611;She shoves me aside with such force that I hear something break... only... it's not me that's broken. My steward stares down at the arrow stuck deep in her chest, then looks up at me. Tears well in her eyes. \nAbove us on the ramparts, the archer nocks his second arrow. My shield-sister is quicker. She hurls her blade with all her strength and he dies with a sword in his neck. We rush to our companion's side as she collapses and I hold her in my lap. \n"Mistress," she whimpers. "I'm... I'm cold." Blood trickles from between her lips. My poor girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_611;"Rest now, sister. Your family is waiting for you.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_612;I gently lay her down after she's gone, shaking with fury. I take a moment to offer a prayer over her body. "The cult claims another," I say, taking up my sword. \n"The cult has claimed their last," my shield-sister replies. We exchange a knowing nod, our resolve hardened, and make our way to the doors. Shouldering our way through, we are unprepared for what we find. \nA hooded man stands at an altar surrounded by candles, curved dagger in hand and poised to strike. His victim - a maiden barely old enough to wed - lies bound with ropes awaiting her death. As she struggles to escape, it becomes clear to me though my mind can hardly believe it. She appears to be... levitating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_612;"Stop, fiend!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_613;The hooded man gazes up at me, and his eyes blaze a searing red beneath his hood. A motion of his hand sends the maiden flying to the side where she's pinned to a column through unseen forces, and the man strides towards us. A primal fear envelops my chest. Gripping my sword tightly, I'm reminded of the tavernkeep's warning - I am not facing any mere mortal this day. \nWe charge him together and attack with everything we have, but the man is quick - far quicker than I've ever seen. His movements are a complete blur. With only his dagger he parries both our swords and slashes at us, and though his blade only scrapes against my armour, I feel its cold sting slice through flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_613;What sorcery is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_614;He reaches out for me and clenches his fist around nothing, yet I feel my throat tighten all the same. I gasp for air and struggle to find this invisible noose he's closed around my neck, but I'm helpless to resist this power. My life flashes before my eyes. \n"Release her, you bastard!" my shield-sister yells, bringing her sword down on the man's elbow. His arm flops to the floor and whatever forces were suffocating me vanish in an instant. \nThe man, unfazed by his severed limb, turns on my companion and runs her through with his dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_614;"No...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_615;My shield-sister lands with a thud, dead before she hits the ground. Only by the blood pooling around her body do I realise the lack thereof dripping from the man's arm. With an insulting air of indifference to his crimes, he leaves his dagger buried in my companion's chest and picks his limb off the floor. He presses it back into place at his elbow and, moments later, his fingers twitch back to life. \n"What are you?" I rasp. \nHe looks down on me with a hollow mirthlessness and replies, "I am the Dark Lord's chosen. No man has ever defeated me.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_615;"I am no man. And nor is *she*.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_616;Though he's fast, he isn't fast enough. The young maiden, having freed herself from her restraints, plunges the curved dagger deep into the man's back, and a pulse of smokey mist emanates from the wound. I hear a terrible noise - like a distant beastly howl - emerging from the blade, and I dare not waste another second. I take up my sword and cleave through his neck in one clean stroke. As his head rolls along the floor with a surprised look etched across his face, the sanctum goes silent. Only now does the vile creature bleed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_616;"Let us pray to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] he stays dead.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_617;Word of the cult's demise travels quickly, and my return home is greeted with celebration. Dancers swirl through the crowds and musicians play triumphant ballads for the magnificent spectacle. I only wish my companions were still alive to see it. \n"You're a hero, m'lady," [cult_maiden_target.GetFirstName] tells me, sensing my grief. "And you saved my life." \n"I didn't do it alone," I reply. "We both owe our lives to those we buried. None of this would have been possible without them. Indeed, I hereby vow to honour their memories. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_617;Until we meet again, my sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_6175;[cult_maiden_target.GetFirstName] has been fitting in well at court since her parents were slain by those cultists. I've since adopted her into House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], though I wonder if I couldn't do a little more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_6175;I'll legitimse her! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_6175;Her parents are gone, I'm really all she has.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_6175;No need. She's fine where she is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_618;"I'm afraid I can't say much, seeing as how I don't know that much. We had some sailors come through here only a few years ago. They saw - or so they claimed - a great storm swallow up an entire fleet of merchant vessels sailing through the bay." He drums his fingers on the counter, lost in thought. "Of course, that's nothing out of the usual. Storms sink ships all the time. Sailors likewise enjoy telling tall tales. Superstitious lot, they are. But this weren't no ordinary storm. Oh, no. Because alongside this sudden tempest appeared another ship - a ship what weathered the storm like it was but a calm summer's breeze.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_618;"Impossible. What could give one ship such an advantage?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_619;"Exactly why such a story were worth noting down, miss," the tavernkeep nods. "Because it weren't simply the case that the ship appeared during the sudden storm. They say - these sailors - that the ship *brought* the storm. It sailed in the eye, such that it avoided the thrashing winds altogether, and when it came about, the storm followed."\n"You mean to say the ship and the storm were somehow working together?" I ask incredulously.\n"I mean to say nothing of the sorts, miss. Only what the sailors told me. They combed the waters for days after the event and uncovered neither body nor flotsam. The entire merchant fleet vanished without a trace.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_619;"Unbelievable as it may be, the story could be worth investigating further.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_620;I've spent days scouring through various sources pertaining to this mysterious event from the Bay of Biscay. At first I thought I'd find nothing but more hearsay anecdotes from sailors and drunken fools, let alone anything at all, but I was quite wrong. More than just sailors, but trusted government officials, renowned historians and even members of clergy all claim to have witnessed similar incidences for over a hundred years! What's more, the events are entirely localised to Biscay and the stories always follow the same formula without discrepancy. First a storm, then a mysterious ship, and then all parties disappear leaving no evidence of the deed. My mind is made up. I must uncover the truth behind this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_620;Bon voyage!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_621;"The stories are nonsense, m'lady!" the old seacaptain assures me. He was sure to wait until after I'd paid for passage before speaking up. He curls the whiskers of his moustache as he speaks. "I've sailed these waters a thousand times, I have. Not once have I ever seen such an event as you describe. Ships commanding storms? Impossible."\nThe crew is in good spirits as we set sail. Once a sailor breaks into song, the whole ship takes up the call. I hadn't expected sailing to be so musical. It's a good nine hours since we left port when the captain finds me on the deck.\n"Like I said, m'lady. Nothing but clear skies and empty horizons. There be no dragons in reality.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_621;"I'm sorry to waste your time, captain.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_622;"No harm done, m'lady." He smiles a toothy grin, and it seems that his silver tooth sparkles. Then I hear a distant rumble of thunder. I look out across the water to see a black cloud forming on the western sky, billowing out and growing larger by the second. Lightning crackles through its shadows and a sudden gust of wind sweeps through our sails. "All hands on deck!" the seacaptain yells. "To stations!"\nThe crew madly scurries to regain control of the ship, pulling on the rigging and wrestling against the rudder, but the gale has quickly gained the upper hand. The ship groans in pain as the hull twists amid the crashing waves. I catch a brief glimpse of a sail on the horizon - a white skull on a black sheet - when I hear the yardarm snap overhead. There's no time to get out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_622;This is gonna hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_623;I awaken to the taste of seawater. Opening my eyes, I'm surprised to find I've not been washed ashore, nor am I drifting through the water on a pile of flotsam. I'm on a huge ship, bound to the main mast with several yards of rope, the white skull fluttering high above. In front of me is the rest of my crew. They're chained up on the deck and held hostage by a ragged band of... zombie pirates! My sudden panic shocks me out of my concussed stupor.\n"Ahh," a commanding voice bellows from behind me. "Ye're finally awake."\nI twist around as the speaker comes into by field of view. He's a barrel-chested beast of a pirate with a long red coat and a massive tricorn hat. His black beard writhes across his face and his flesh is all green and rotten. \n"I've found ye at last, m'dear Eleanor.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_623;"Eleanor? My name is [Root.GetFirstName] and I demand you release us!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_624;"Eleanor..." the pirate teases. "Don't ye recognise me? It's le Jaques! Yer suitor! Granted I've lost a bit o' weight o'er the last few decades but undeath'll do that to a man. I'm still as fit as I e'er was!" His round belly makes a rattling noise as he pats it.\n"Wait a minute," I say, "I do know you! You're the dread pirate le Jaques, the most notorious pirate to sail the seas! But your ship went missing almost two centuries ago with all hands lost while searching for the fabled Simian Isle!"\n"And I barely look a day o'er a hundred! I know, the brine truly does wonders for the skin. And ye're also looking well, m'dear. So? Have ye given thought to me proposal?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_624;"What proposal? I've never met ye. Ahem. You. I've never met you.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_625;"Ohhh, ye coquettish sea wench," le Jaques says. He clearly believes I'm this Eleanor person. "I thought ye might be needing some reminding. After all, what wealthy heiress to the de Marleis estate would marry a lowly sailor such as I?"\n"Marry?" My eyes widen. "You want me to *marry* you?!"\n"O' course! And to help persuade ye o' me manly charms, how about a demonstration o' me skills?" He turns to address his crew, stance akimbo. "Whaddya say, lads? Fancy a fresh face around here?"\nThe walking corpses he calls a crew stand gaunt and emotionless, periodically twitching and rattling, swaying gently with the roll of the ship.\n"Hooo, they be ecstatic!" le Jaques roars. "'Tis the most excitement they seen in decades!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_625;That's a curious accent for a Frenchman...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_626;He stomps over to a pile of spare rigging and pulls out a long coil of rope. "Two centuries be a long time at sea, Eleanor," he says, his skeletal hands working to form a noose. "And me crew has a habit o' falling o'er board at the worst o' times. Also getting picked apart by seagulls, the damned screeching sky devils! So, as ye can probably imagine, the turnover rate be surprisingly high for a successful pirate." He then stomps his way to where my crew are chained and drops the noose down around the neck of the old whiskered seacaptain. With little effort, he drags the captain kicking and struggling to the side of the ship and throws him over the edge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_626;"What are you doing!?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_627;"Being undead ain't all it's cracked up to be." Le Jaques leisurely binds the other end of the rope to a rigging block as the coil slowly unwinds and the old seacaptain's gargled cries for help drift farther and farther aftward. "Me fashion sense be outdated, fair maidens faint at me sight - and not in the flattering way - and nobody's made me favourite brand o' grog in o'er a century." He knots the rope secure just as the line runs out. It snaps taut with a twang and the seacaptain's cries are suddenly silenced. Le Jaques begins to haul the rope back in, monologuing all the while. "But it ain't all sad fiddles and melancholy. The magics that keep me spirit here also grant me... other strengths." The seacaptain's wet corpse appears over the edge and he flops down on the deck. Then he twitches, rises up, and stares at me. His silver tooth sparkles in a twisted mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_627;Eww. Gross.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_628;"Impressive, no?" le Jaques asks, smiling through his wriggling black beard. "Shame he be so old! Hold on, I'll find one less shrivelled."\n"No, stop!" I yell. "I agree! I'll marry you!"\nLe Jaques' lifeless grey eyes light up with with glee. "Ye will?! Do ye hear that, lads? We're having a wedding!"\nThe zombie crew rattles and sways with excitement.\n"On one condition," I add, thinking of a plan. "You'll have to beat me in a sword fight first. But if you lose, you must set us all free. Do you accept?"\nThe zombie pirate laughs boldly and draws his curved sabre. "Such fire, m'dear! Such fire!" He slashes the ropes pinning me to the mast and I instantly steal a sword off one of his crew.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_628;"En garde!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_629;Our blades meet in a whirlwind of steel. He has good form - for a walking corpse - but I can hold my own in a fight.\n\n"People fall at me feet when they see me coming!" le Jaques spits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_629;"Even *before* they smell your breath?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_630;I unleash a mad flurry, swinging my sword high and low in quick succession. Le Jaques retreats across the deck before catching my blade again.\n\n"Me last fight ended with me hands covered with blood," he sneers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_630;"Your hemorrhoids are flaring up again, eh?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_630;"I hope now you've learned to stop picking your nose.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_630;"How appropriate. You fight like a cow!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_631;He lunges at me unexpectedly. I have no option but to surrender whatever ground I've gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_631;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_632;I duck and weave beneath his sabre, slashing at every opportunity. Our blades grind together and our guards interlock.\n\n"Nobody's e'er drawn blood from me and nobody e'er will," he menaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_632;"You run THAT fast?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_632;"You make me think somebody already did.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_632;"I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_633;Le Jaques retreats again to the forecastle. A flash of lightning casts his grim visage in shadow. He levels his sabre against mine and tries to knock it out of my hand!\n\n"There be no clever moves that can help ye now," he boasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_633;"I'd be in real trouble if you ever used them.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AmzCulSoc_633;"Why, did you want to borrow one?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_AmzCulSoc_633;"Yes there are. You just never learned them.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_634;I toss my sabre high in the air and declare my vulnerability with open arms. Le Jaques takes the bait and moves to thrust at me with his blade, but I leap out and over the edge of the ship, swinging on the rigging, and land behind him. I catch my sword without even looking and stab him through the chest. He collapses against the foremast as I slip my blade under his chin. "Return to the watery grave from whence you came, you deviant, obnoxious, slithery, creepy-crawly zombie!" I growl.\nHe looks up at me with sunken hollow eyes. "I am rubber... You... are g-" he chokes on the final word. The storm dissipates immediately and his undead crew drop in a mass of bones.\nVictory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_634;I sure hope he doesn't return as a demon pirate later.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_635;Word of le Jaques' demise precedes my return home and I'm greeted by a veritable entourage of admirers. It was a good thing his ship was still seaworthy, lest I may not have been able to return at all! The crew all confirmed each other's accounts of the incident and the corpses served as undeniable evidence of the wicked truth. I walked away from that day as a heroine to all, the woman who finally defeated the dread pirate haunting the Bay of Biscay. My name is now synonymous with artful swordplay.\nI pity anyone else who wishes to cross blades with me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_635;My tongue is sharper than any sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_636;"Still something of recent news, miss. Women's fashion nowadays is as much a mystery to me as to the next man. Why wear glass slippers when fur would be far more cosy, and why use all that fabric on a long skirt what don't even include a pocket or two? But all that's beside the point." He flicks through his ledger until he reaches the final pages. Squinting over his own nose, he finds the entry in question. "Yes, here we are. Word is that there's a fine young duke who's looking for any information what might help him uncover the identity and/or location of a certain fine young woman he met at a ball. Lots of individuals both fine and young, apparently. I think it prudent to add at this point, miss, that I don't employ any creative licence in these notes - I merely write them as I hears them.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_636;"As you say. Do you know anything more of this duke?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_637;"Aside from the aforementioned qualities of youth and finery, I've heard very little about the duke himself. He reigns over one of those small semi-autonomous duchies in the middle of a much larger empire. One of his balls was rather large... ahem, pardon, miss. He held a very large ball one eve... no... that's... ugh." The tavernkeep nervously wipes his reddening brow with a dishcloth. "He had a big party, you see. And at this party he met a young woman who was completely unknown to him and his other guests. Probably the kind of party where everyone wears a mask, if I had to guess. The lady left unexpectedly before he could learn her name, leaving only a single glass slipper behind. The duke has been searching for his mystery guest ever since. Furthermore, he has apparently offered a significant reward to the one what finds his woman.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_637;"In the pursuit of true love, no price is too high. That works for me!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_638;I spend days searching for more information pertaining to this duke and his mystery woman. Books, unsurprisingly, have yielded little fruit. Most of what I learn comes through word of mouth from travellers and merchants and the like. The duke himself is something of an upstart. No noble blood runs in his veins and his family lineage is untraceable. How exactly he became a duke is a question to which I'm yet to find a solid answer. It could be he bought the title, as it's known the duke is exceedingly wealthy. As for the woman with the glass slipper, however, the only thing I've managed to learn about her is perhaps the only trait that was readily available to the witnesses that night: the colour of her hair, a deep golden-brown. It's not a lot to form the basis of this expedition but I suppose it's a start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_638;I hope this doesn't take too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_639;This country is simply breathtaking. Beautiful verdant fields stretch across rolling hills as far as the eye can see, and rows of vineyards surround rich estates. The scent of hot meals wafts through the breeze as I make my way into town. The streets are paved with smooth cobblestone and all the buildings are painted with vibrant colours. Everyone seems so cheerful and carefree, from the simple peasants running their errands to the traders spruiking their wares. It's like I've been transported into some idyllic fairy tale world. I arrive at the ducal palace in the town centre and introduce myself to the pair of door guards, stating my business as an adventurer answering the duke's request. They exchange a quick nod before seeing me inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_639;"Thank you, gentlemen.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_640;The interior of the palace is no less spectacular. The polished wooden floors are lined with elegant rugs sporting intricate geometric designs and life-like frescos decorate almost every wall. I find myself eagerly inspecting the environment for more impressive artistry as I'm escorted through the halls and into the ducal court.\n"A traveller, m'lord," the guard announces, "come to inquire about the slipper."\nThe duke, sitting in a chair fit for a king, sets aside his work to pay me his full attention. He seems surprised by my gear and stares at me with avid interest, tenting his fingers. "And you are...?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_640;"[Root.GetFirstName]. I heard you needed help and thought I might provide it.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_641;"No doubt what caught your attention was the offer of reward?" the duke asks suspiciously. "But it makes no difference to me. I'm not lacking in funds." He rises from his throne and struts towards the window, nostalgically staring off into the distance. "She was the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen. The way she danced, the way she laughed, the way she looked at me. I'm not a weak man, [Root.GetFirstName], but she turned me into jelly that night. Every so often I recall the smell of her amber hair and my heart skips a beat."\n"That's all well and good, my lord," I interrupt, "but I'm here to help you find her, not to recite poetic musings."\n"Of course," he agrees. "I suppose I should at least show you the slipper.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_641;"If you wouldn't mind.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_642;The duke returns to his throne and reaches behind it for a small box - something resembling a reliquary - and carefully pops it open. There inside is a single glass slipper, clear as crystal with a heel twice as high as my finger is long. I must admit, uncomfortable though it may be to wear, the craftsmanship is simply incredible.\n"I finally got a moment with her all to myself... and then she ran. She left in such a hurry I didn't even have time to learn her name. She lost this slipper on the staircase. It's all I have to remember her by."\n"Nothing else?" I ask. "You didn't learn anything unique about her? Any clues to her identity? Nothing at all?"\n"Perhaps I might have done," the duke laments, "but she was gone at the call of midnight.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_642;I can already tell this is going to be tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_643;I've checked all the usual suspects. That is to say I can't find any amber-haired women at any of the town's brothels, let alone any wearing a single glass slipper. It's entirely possible, given the strange circumstances of this mystery woman's presence at the ball, that her current whereabouts are just as strange and unexpected. She may be the wife or daughter of a travelling merchant and is now countless miles away. Or perhaps she quietly perished some time ago and nobody will ever learn her name or her reasons for remaining anonymous. The longer I meander around in this quaint little duchy, the closer I come to realising that this was a poor choice of a quest. It's less an exhilarating adventure and more a drawn-out existential crisis. And the only clues I have to find this woman are the colour of her hair and a glass slipper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_643;Come to think of it... where would she even get a glass slipper?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_644;"His lord duke's men have already asked me," the master glassblower says without looking up from his piece. "Ain't sold no glass slippers to nobody, ain't made no glass slippers for nobody, and we don't make no glass slippers anyways."\n"You work here alone?" I ask.\n"Just me and me apprentices. This foundry's been in me family for generations. Me father were a blower, and his father, and his father, and so on. I seen the slipper in question last time I were asked and it's beyond the skills of me lads to work the glass like that. I can't help you."\nI thank the man for his time and turn to leave when I catch something moving on the other side of the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_644;Who was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_645;I race outside just in time to spot the shadow duck down behind a low wall. Not taking any chances, I quietly draw my sword and make my approach. "Why are you watching me?!" I growl as I leap over the barrier, catching my shadow unprepared.\nThe young woman yelps in fright, muffling her scream with a shivering hand. She's unarmed and only wearing a simple apron. It's then that I notice a few strands of hair peeking out from beneath her bonnet - a curious shade of golden-brown. The girl looks so feeble and defenseless that it doesn't seem appropriate to keep my blade drawn. I sheathe my sword and offer her my hand instead.\n"I'm not going to hurt you," I say. "I just want to talk."\nA moment passes before the young woman allows me to hoist her up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_645;"Perhaps we should go somewhere more private.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_646;"I'm not going back," the girl says with defiance once we're alone. "You can't make me."\nOn the contrary, I'm sure I could make her if I wanted to. But I'm a Heroine of the Hall, and such actions would be improper. "Tell me everything about that night. Start with how you got the slippers."\n"I made them," she says as if the answer were obvious. "I made my dress, too, not that anyone cares."\n"You must know a lot about blowing. Glass, that is."\n"You tend to learn a lot of trades when you make your living sweeping the floors of workshops. I've been working there for years, ever since... well...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_646;"Yes? Go on.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_647;The young woman sighs. "When I was just a little girl, my village was raided by a gang of brutal mercenaries who marched beneath a large crimson banner. They slaughtered half the village and enslaved many more. It was only by [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s will that I escaped with my life. I fled to this town and found work as a cleaner. Years went by and we got this new duke. He was so handsome. All I ever wanted was to see one his magnificent balls up close."\n"Ahem!" I cough suddenly. "And?"\n"I finally got my wish. I slipped past the guards one evening of a party and fulfilled my dreams. I danced and drank and caught many a nobleman's eye, and the duke himself was so enamoured with me that he invited me upstairs to his private quarters."	;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_647;"What went wrong?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_648;"We finally had a moment to ourselves. It was late, we were both a little dizzy from dancing, and he turned his back to pour us both another drink. That's when I discovered evidence that he was part of that same company of sellswords that raided my village! It was a huge red flag! Hanging over his bed. I'd know it anywhere. I beat a hasty escape at once but, alas, I tripped on the stairs and lost one of my slippers." She reaches into the front pocket of her apron and reveals the missing slipper, a mirror image of the one the duke showed me. "Take it, please. I don't want it anymore. Take it as proof that you found me. Just please don't tell him who I am.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_648;"You have my word.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_649;The duke leans forward in his throne, eyes wide with astonishment. "That's her slipper! You found her! You actually found her! Well? Speak! Where is my lady love?"\nI clear my throat. "She doesn't want to see you again. What's more, she claims to have found a crimson banner amongst your belongings - the same kind flown by a certain mercenary company that raided her village some years ago."\nThe duke sneers at me. "Is this an accusation? Do you expect me to deny it? A good artist never denies his trade, and mine is the art of war. I wear those colours proudly. I was given this land for my services to the Empire, waging the Emperor's wars and bringing peace to boring little towns like this. Now, are you going to tell me where my woman is or do I have to force the answer out of you?" While he speaks, the room slowly fills with more of his guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_649;"Perhaps I didn't introduce myself properly, lord duke...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_650;"My name is [Root.GetDynName]. I am a Heroine of the Hall, a shieldmaiden sworn to defend those under my protection. You may think you have the upper hand at this moment. You would be wrong. If you sic your men on me then I will have no choice but to draw my sword, and then you shall bear witness to how I ply *my* trade." As I notice the duke's men circling around and moving to block the exit, I slowly reach for my hilt. "So, you ought to think very carefully about your next action, because if you do not allow me to fulfil my vow and grant me safe passage out of this room, then I shall be only too glad to carve my way out instead. Therefore I ask politely: please, call off your men."\nThe duke rises from his throne, his shoulders squared. "Request denied.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_650;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_651;Everything happens at once. The ducal guard to my left lowers his halberd and charges, while the guard on my right flashes a longsword. My blade at the ready, I parry the oncoming point and deflect its momentum into the longswordsman's armpit, circling around and slicing the halberdier's throat with a swift backhand. The longswordsman wails in agony and drops his weapon, so I leave him alone for the time being while I deal with the rest of his comrades. Pure pandemonium ensues as the entire ducal retinue comes at me. One after another, I hack off limbs and heads and leave their corpses in a growing pool of blood. By the time I'm the last one still standing, even the air itself has turned red. I take a moment to catch my breath and appreciate the carnage I've wrought. Finally, a bit of excitement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_651;But where did that villainous duke go?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_652;"Turn, she-devil!" He appears in the doorway behind me armed with sword and shield. "I'll mount your head on a pike for what you've done!"\nTurning to wipe my blade on one of his men's tunics, I say, "It seems your men melt like butter when they're not slaughtering unarmed peasants." He takes the bait, as I knew he would, and comes roaring at me with sword raised. I hardly need to do anything as he slips on the blood decorating his polished floors and tumbles into the wall behind me, though not before I leave him a little gift.\nRolling over, he stares in horror at the glass slipper in his lap... and the stiletto heel I sank deep into his upper thigh. Blood gushes from the wound like a wellspring. "You snicked my artery, you filthy slattern!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_652;"I did. You may want to keep some pressure on that.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_653;I make my way to the exit, casually stepping over bodies as the duke curses my existence. "I'll forgo my payment, lord duke," I say. "It was attractive at first, but, like the rest of your home, the grandiose charm appears a little tainted now. You can keep the gold as compensation for what happens next."\nThe duke only glares at me with a blanched and vacant expression as I take a lantern off the wall. With a lazy throw, I cast it back into the room. The oil canister explodes on impact and the flames spread quickly across the floor, up the walls and into the rafters. I leave the duke to die, curious as to what will take his life first.\nThe smoke, the fire, or the rapid blood loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_653;"Get used to the heat. There's more of that where you're going.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_654;It's long since I watched that palace burn that the scent of smoke still triggers fond memories.\nNow, returning home, townsfolk go quiet as I pass. They hang their heads and dare not look me in the eye. Those brave enough to meet my gaze only do it to curse my name, and only ever from a safe distance. They know what I've done. They know what I'm capable of doing again. And I'd be lying if this knowledge didn't bring me some small amount of glee. It's good to be loved but fear is a tool so seldom wielded, and not to be underestimated.\nFor reasons justified or not, my name now strikes dread into all who face me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_654;They'll all meet the same fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_655;"I wonder where it came from," the tavernkeep says as he rubs his chin. He delicately passes it over the counter. The letter is stamped with a wax seal depicting a crescent moon and a curved dagger. I pop it open and read aloud.\n"'To the Heroine [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]. The time has come for your sorority to disband. Your prideful ambition has gotten you far, but we will have no other recourse than to consider you our enemies if you fail to meet our demands. This is your first and only warning.' It's signed, 'the Assasiyeen'."\n"The Assasiyeen?" the tavernkeep asks. "Oh, miss. This could be bad.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_655;"Assasiyeen? I've heard that name before.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_656;The tavernkeep nods. "I should think so. Those killers are all about humility and dutiful observance to their tenets, but it's not so unsuspecting as that. Intimidation is their main weapon. And whoever refuses to be intimidated is usually found face-down in a puddle some time later having tripped and fallen on their own dagger several times. There are many unexplained deaths surrounded in whispers of these killers. Kings and sultans alike, even their wives and children in some cases. Dangerous lot, miss. Dangerous lot."\nA chill runs down my spine. I glance over my shoulder at the tavern's other patrons, wondering if any of them are here for me. I lift my hood and make for the door without another word.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_656;Best take a different route home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_657;Having spent the last few days fearing these zealots, I've come to a troubling realisation. We could have been allies with the Assasiyeen. They, like us, are viewed as an existential threat to the world order - the flames licking at the very fabric of society. And they, like us, have made great strides towards a new global philosophy of accountability and reliance on individual strength, questioning the legitimacy of Kings. But that is where our potential for friendship ends. The Heroines fight for honour, for sisterhood and faith in ourselves. The Assasiyeen fight as their own whims dictate. They have qualms with neither murder nor subterfuge and will heartlessly slaughter any number of innocents who stand in their way. And now they have marked our sorority for death. Therefore, I cannot stand idle. It's time to take the fight to them. Their leader must be removed, their secrecy laid bare.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_657;For the good of my shield-sisters, it must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_658;I only wish there were another way. But what other way is there than to journey into the belly of the beast, to travel into the very heartlands of the enemy? I'm soon presented with another problem, however. How does one locate a guild that not only wants to remain hidden, but has successfully remained hidden despite making hosts of powerful enemies all throughout the region?\nI roam around the crowded bazaar for hours towards sunset, watching the goings on from beneath the shadow of my veil. Nothing catches my attention at first - the Levantine people are just like any other. The merchants boast of their fine wares to the hordes of potential customers weaving through the rows of stalls, and children loudly run amok by the fountains. Caped patrols do their rounds, less interested in actually keeping the peace so much as just looking busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_658;These Assasiyeen could be hiding anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_659;I'm about to move on to another area when I sense I'm being watched. That's when I spot a man in a white hood lurking at the opposite end of the plaza, just standing there. I'm curious as to his motives until he brings a hand up to his neck and threateningly drags his finger across his throat. It leaves no question in my mind as to who he is or, more importantly, whom he works for. I move to approach him, hoping I might wrangle some valuable answers out of him, but a large crowd comes between us and I lose line of sight. I force my way through but the hooded man is gone by the time I've cleared the group. Cursing under my breath, I wheel around and try to search for him again. The man has simply vanished into thin air.\nAt least it seems that way until I see a flash of white robes vanish around a corner!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_659;After him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_660;I race to other side of the plaza and round the corner just in time to see the man duck into a side street. I follow quickly, getting to the next corner in seconds, but again only catch a glimpse of him descending a staircase into a tunnel. My tenacity gets the better of me and I give chase.\nThe path ahead of me is dark, so I steal a lit torch from a nearby sconce and venture forth. The way opens up into some kind of catacomb. There is an eerie sense that I'm still being watched, and not necessarily by the hundreds of skulls lining the walls. My torch does little to illuminate the surroundings. The dust-covered stones beneath my feet reveal nothing of recent tracks. I turn to retrace my steps when I suddenly come face to face with the hooded man... and the dagger he's buried two inches into my belly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_660;Uh-oh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_661;I shove him away and draw my sword as my attacker vanishes back into the shadows. The villain could have gutted me if not for the armour under my cloak. That's not a mistake he'll make twice. I swipe my torch left and right, scanning the darkness for any glimmer of movement. All I see are bones - stark reminders of my mortality.\nI hear the crunch of sand behind me and turn just in time to block his attempt at slicing my neck open. He tries again, this time from the other side, but I twist out of his reach. I counter with a move of my own, except he ducks beneath my blade and slices the top of my thigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_661;This isn't going well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_662;I stagger backwards. It's impossible to fight him while he's so close! I regret coming down here - my sword is not an appropriate weapon for such tight quarters and I'm at a severe disadvantage. Every injury I take only serves to make me slower against an enemy who's already too quick. There's no other option. It's retreat or die. \nI make a desperate play to escape by throwing my torch at him. He deflects it with an effortless slash of his knife and sends the flame bouncing across the floor. I stumble off in the opposite direction, as fast as I can manage, clutching my wounds as hot blood wells from between my fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_662;I'll need to circle around behind him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_663;The man's mocking laughter echoes around me. I swing my sword preemptively through the dark, clanging loudly off the colonnades. Back and forth, back and forth, I pray my blade meets flesh. For a brief moment, I feel his hot breath on the back of my neck. Then I feel a sharp pain in my shoulder where his dagger slid in between my armour. He could have ended me there. He had the chance. He refused to take it.\nThe bastard's toying with me.\nI need to get out of here NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_663;Please, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. I don't want to die with a clean sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_664;I only manage as far as the torch before my legs give out. I roll onto my back, still clutching my weapon, and watch as the man materialises from the shadows before me.\n"You thought the darkness was your ally," he whispers gloatingly, readying his dagger for the coup de grace. "You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it."\nSomething wet and pointy suddenly juts out from the centre of his chest and he coughs up a mouthful of blood.\n"And now you die in it," comes another voice.\nHe lurches to one side and hits the ground with a heavy thud.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_664;... Who?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_665;Out of the shadows emerges another mystery figure in grey robes. The shade steps into the torchlight and reveals herself as a woman with silver hair and olive skin. "It's not often that a girl follows a strange man down a dark alleyway. You're fortunate I came when I did." She looks me up and down with scrutinising indifference. "You're bleeding."\n"Yes," I reply. "I noticed."\n"Can you stand? I don't want to have to carry you."\nI roll onto my one good arm and try to push myself up. I've lost a lot of blood, and my limbs shake beneath my weight, but I finally make it to my feet. Notably, the old woman made no effort to help me stand. She comes across as very aloof for somebody who just saved my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_665;"What's your name, stranger?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_666;"I suppose you may call me 'Masdar'," she replies. "It's not my real name but names aren't really important. What's important right now is that we have a common enemy and I need your help to defeat him. Of slightly less importance is your state of blood loss."\n"Your concern is heartwarming," I scoff. "Is that the only reason you just saved my life? This 'common enemy' or ours?"\nShe shrugs slightly. "I found an Asasi so I killed him. You proved a useful distraction at the time. But you're not useful to me dead. I can do my best to treat your wounds if you'll come with me. I'll have to trust you won't faint along the way." With that, the old woman shuffles off towards the catacombs' exit and leaves me to follow behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_666;"You may call me [Root.GetFirstName]... not that it matters.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_667;We return to Masdar's home past sunset. After she's patched me up, she sets a steaming bowl of soup in front of me with half a loaf of bread floating in it. It smells awful, but I expect she's the type who would take it off me out of spite if I so much as commented on it, so I diligently set about pouring it down my gullet. "I owe you my thanks," I say, "though I can't escape this feeling that you owe me an explanation or two. Why are the Assasiyeen after you?"\nMasdar sits opposite me on a cushion. "More accurately, it is I who is after them. Even more accurately, I'm after their leader. My brother."\nI almost spit out my bread, and not just because of the taste. "Your brother is the grandmaster of the Assasiyeen?"\n"Unfortunately, yes. Which is precisely why I need you to kill him.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_667;"I don't want to get involved in a murderous case of sibling rivalry.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_668;"Nor would you be. But while our goals are the same, we may as well work together. My brother is among the most dangerous men in the world and you'll need all the help you can to kill him."\n"Which begs the question: if you're capable of helping me do it, why are you incapable of killing him yourself?"\nMasdar inhales deeply. "Because he's still my brother. We were orphaned as children after our parents were murdered by religious zealots. All we had was each other. Even at that young age, we showed promise in our future professions. We trained as pickpockets and roof-runners, free climbing the tallest buildings and learning to move in complete silence, all with one goal in mind.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_668;"And what goal was that?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_669;"To kill, of course. To reap vengeance on those who had wronged us. It is one thing to slay an enemy in personal combat, but to eradicate whole dynasties without anyone ever seeing the blade is another thing entirely."\n"Sounds like a dishonourable way to fight, if you ask me."\n"And to let thousands of soldiers die in battle while thousands more innocents suffer in the aftermath... that is preferable? No. A few well-placed strikes at the heart of the problem is far more efficient. War is chaos. Murder is predictable. And so it was with us for many years. We lived in the shadows. We killed as needed killing. But the power of the hidden blade is as intoxicating as any opiate.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_669;"And your brother became addicted?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_670;Masdar nods slowly. "He began the wholesale slaughter of any he perceived as enemies whether justified or not. And with his skills, his targets never survived long enough to change his mind. As I said - my brother is a dangerous man."\n"I certainly get that impression. One doesn't become the leader of a gang of murdering psychopaths without at least a little talent for the nefarious. But how do you expect me to kill him if his skills so greatly surpass my own?"\nThe old woman rises from her cushion and regards me with a profound sense of purpose. "Precisely why you're still alive and not bleeding out in the dark. I'll teach you everything I know. Now get some rest. Your training begins at sunrise.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_670;I suppose I have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_671;Time flashes by in my mind's eye as I go from one activity to the next. Masdar starts me off with a rep of push-ups, moving onto sit-ups while hanging inverted from a beam. Later in the day, she sets up a dummy for me to practise some swift strikes with a dagger. As I work up a sweat, she looks on with the satisfaction of a proud parent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_671;Just a woman and her will to survive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_672;I'm getting better at push-ups and can clap my hands between presses now! Masdar has also given me a heavy ball to hold while doing my sit-ups and I feel my core strength improving quickly. At night, she sends me out to race laps across the rooftops and records my best times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_672;Rising up to the challenge of our rival!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_673;I never knew it was possible to do a push-up with one hand! I've got muscles in places I didn't even know I had. My stomach is rock-hard and I can sprint across the rooftops in complete silence. What an incredible feeling being so fit!\nMasdar places a hand on my shoulder one evening, a single tear in her eye. It's the only time I've seen her smile. "You're ready.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_673;I must survive to keep my shield-sisters alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_674;Still no sight of any Asasi. All I can see from my perch are the glows of the windows far below and the twinkle of the stars above. \nMasdar caught word of her brother's next target, the new commander of the local garrison force, and I've been stalking him ever since. While not an evil man, he's a known philanderer and frequenter of the city's less savoury establishments. He entered the courtesan's house after his shift ended a few hours ago and hasn't come out since. If history is any indication then he's unlikely to emerge until the early hours, whereby he'll return home, apologise to his wife for spending the night on patrol, then return to work ahead of his next shift. And so it has been for several days.\nThat is, until I spot the shadow hopping across the rooftops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_674;Does he think he can hide from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_675;The shadow leaps from one building to the next, as silent as the night, before arriving on the brothel's rooftop. The commander, currently in flagrante delicto with a pair of young women, remains oblivious to the imminent threat directly above him.\nI drop down from my perch and land without a sound, careful to approach the Asasi from behind. Slowly, so as not to make too much noise, I unsheathe my dagger. I'm counting down the steps until I reach my target, visualising each swift movement needed to execute the perfect kill. That's when the Asasi, without so much as a twitch, suddenly speaks.\n"I'm impressed," he says. "You were marked for death weeks ago, yet still you draw breath.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_675;"You'll find I have a nasty habit of surviving.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_676;The Asasi turns, revealing his identity. His aquiline nose and long grey beard match the description provided by Masdar, and the distinct trim of his cloak only serves to confirm my suspicion. This is the man - this is the grandmaster of the Assasiyeen. "A habit I shall help you in breaking," he warns.\n"I'm surprised you knew I was here," I say. "I could have sworn I was completely silent."\n"Why listen for footsteps when you can smell fear." The Asasi turns to his side, concealing the movements of his right hand. "The powerful shall be ripped from their decadent nests and cast into the gutters below. You cannot stop what has already begun. We are inevitable.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_676;"Let's see about that!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_677;I pounce at him, my dagger glinting in the moonlight. He only twists to avoid my blade completely and slams his knee into my gut. It's less effective than he might have hoped due to my training and I manage to spin away before he brings his own dagger down where I would have been. He pauses. "I see now how you've lived this long. My sister taught you well."\n"Is is that obvious?" I lower my stance and leap back into the fray. A most peculiar duel ensues. We both strike with swift and perfect attacks, yet neither of us can manage to land a single blow. We dodge rather than parry and, combined with our careful footwork, our match takes place in absolute silence.\nNot far beneath our feet, the commander and his girls share a blissfully unaware laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_677;I can't afford to let him tire me out like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_678;I feint and tumble backwards along the rooftop where I appear to misplace my dagger. Quickly getting back on my feet, I raise my bare fists with a panicked expression. Beneath his hood, my opponent offers a smug grin.\n"After I'm finished with you, I'll be sure to eliminate every one of your sisters," he declares. "Then I'll personally reduce your precious lodge to ashes, for I am the Master of Shadows."\n"You'll have to kill me first," I reply.\nHe lunges at me with cat-like agility, gliding through the air. Ducking beneath his reach, I grapple his arm, twist around, and flip him over me. He slams down on the roof with an audible 'shink', impaled by the knife I'd left wedged between the tiles. His white robes turn dark red in the moonlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AmzCulSoc_678;"The shadows betray you... because they belong to me.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AmzCulSoc_679;I return home without fanfare. I left in such secrecy that nobody knew where I'd gone and some hadn't even noticed my absence. But when they see me again, they tell me something seems different. I carry myself in a way I hadn't before, with an air of quiet confidence mixed with an inexplicable sense of danger. Laughing, I shrug off their comments as mere paranoia. How little they know.\nIt's only natural to be afraid of the dark. Many of us claim to have outgrown such a primal fear, but the creaking of a floorboard or the groan of a rusty hinge can still conjure images of monsters lurking in the shadows. Such thoughts are unwarranted, of course.\nThe only real threat hiding in the dark is the one that doesn't make a sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
